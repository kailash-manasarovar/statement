## Communication with criminals

- Sometimes, the online activity seems like they think it is all a game and great fun to terrorize women, drug them, and put them in porn without their consent.
- Sometimes, it seems like they are all arguing with each other and grassing each other up.
- They send me pics and fake accounts sometimes which make me wonder what they are telling me.
- I'm going to add these all on this page, as they arrive, just in case it's helpful.

### Joe's mom

- Of course, Joe's mom, to me, is Lorraine Blackbourn. 
- This account pops up and likes significant posts from the past from time to time.
- I wonder about it.

### Alice Lara

- Lara is a common name in the Denia area. 
- I wonder who Alice Lara is. She looks stressed.
- The man in this pic looks like half of some of the AI-mix pics of the engineer who has been [full time stalking me](../content/images/fake-accounts/messages-oct/13.png).
