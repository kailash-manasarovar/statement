## Significant communication from hackers

- As mentioned in [July 2023 timeline doc](../timeline/2023/july.md#google-search), manipulated results on Google search became one of the key ways the hackers communicated with me.
- I have no idea how they did it but they were able to completely control the result of google search whenever I searched for the following:
    - `"jctot19 twitter"`
    - `"jctot19 x"`
    - `"1frgvn twitter"`
    - `"1frgvn x"`
- I assume it is because they have full root access to all of my devices and can do what they like.
- The `@JackChardwood` account was less significant as I didn't search for this very much at all.
- The `@jctot19` search was extremely significant as there were so few results coming up that anything out of the ordinary stood out, for example:

## Romantic intrigue

- This theme was overwhelming after the [12th June 2023 funeral at the conservatory](../timeline/2023/june.md#monday-12th-june-2023).
- I mention a lot of these in the timeline, especially those coming from the `@sinremite` account, now deleted, which I believe was controlled by Carmen Cano.
- An example of results is here:

![Google searches example](../content/images/google-searches-example.jpg)

- The two top results I saw continuously, for probably up to a year or so, as the top options on Google search for `@jctot19` and `@sinremite` are interesting.
- The first one is part of the *game* and is a well-known Spanish phrase meaning *Whatever you do, I'm one step ahead*.
- The second means *he is one of a kind, I don't think there'll ever be anyone like him*.
- The third, another common theme, refers to nutrition and diet. I believe this is Domingo unable to stop shopping himself.
- I believe the Santiago Garrido account is likely a honey-trap fake account.
- There's so much of this psychological triggering and signposting stuff, I could write a book on it alone.
- In time, I'll get this section organized and point out to the timeline.
