## Significant communication from hackers

- As mentioned in [July 2023 timeline doc](../timeline/2023/july.md#google-search), manipulated results on Google search became one of the key ways the hackers communicated with me.
- I have no idea how they did it but they were able to completely control the result of google search whenever I searched for the following:
    - `"jctot19 twitter"`
    - `"jctot19 x"`
    - `"1frgvn twitter"`
    - `"1frgvn x"`
- I assume it is because they have full root access to all of my devices and can do what they like.
- The `@JackChardwood` account was less significant as I didn't search for this very much at all.
- The `@jctot19` search was extremely significant as there were so few results coming up that anything out of the ordinary stood out, for example:
