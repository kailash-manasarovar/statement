## Fake accounts

- Here is a list of a small proportion the accounts that were, and still are in some cases, cyber stalking me.
- Some are clear images of people I know, especially teachers and staff from the conservatory. I will note that where I can.
- Some are obvious AI merges of people, sometime that I know sometimes not, and me.

!!! important "Disclaimer"
    - It's possible some of these accounts are legit and either I mistook something they genuinely or they were overwritten by hacking techniques.
    - Genuine stalkers embroiled legit accounts into appearing to be stalkers.

- Some I will point out as honey trap accounts; accounts used to lure people into a false sense of security and then, at some point, part with their money. 
- Honey trap accounts double as stalkers given Domingo and the trumpet teacher's whole game is honey trap.
- Some of the stalker accounts will just be retweets, and I believe this is automated.

!!! danger
    - It is also possible that genuine accounts are duplicated and used to harass and intimidate.
    - This happened a lot on my JackChardwood account.
