## Technofix

- I have no idea who these are. I phoned this company in April so I believe it is the cyber expert from Alicante, but they have a different name.
- I made a call to them without realizing it, in Dénia in October 2024.
- It was extremely weird. I think hackers took control of my phone and made this call.

## Patricia
