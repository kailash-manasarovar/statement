## Summary statement

This document details crimes committed against myself, Katharine Margaret Murphy, Y2775989H, currently residing at Carrer Furs 15, Bloque 1, Escalera 2, Piso 3, Apartamento 17, Dénia, 03700 Alicante Spain, not least attempted murder, that have taken place over the three years since moving into the apartment on 15th December 2022.

### Mass voyeurism, cyberstalking, gang stalking, and domestic violence

The report details the following:

- Hacking of my home network, mobile phones, and laptops - including work laptops from three different companies - most likely using insider knowledge of my home router's MAC address.
- Cyber-stalking by teachers, staff, and others at the conservatory of Dénia; their friends and families and, closely connected to them, organized criminal gangs.
- Physical stalking, tracking my movements via my hacked mobile phones, and possibly also tracking on my car, in order to harass me and create intricate choreographed situations with the sole intention of terrorizing me.
- Sexual grooming and honey-trapping online and in a public learning establishment, the conservatory of Dénia.
- Drugging and poisoning without my knowledge; in class at the conservatory, at home, in my car (sprayed and/or through the air vents), and via access to my personal items, such as food and toiletries, so as to continue the dosage while I was traveling away from Dénia for long periods.
- Constant surveillance which included taking photos and videos of me of a sexual nature, and otherwise, from hacked devices and/or hidden cameras, and disseminating them throughout Dénia, and likely making money from them on paid-for WhatsApp groups and/or porn networks.
- Mass voyeurism of myself through my hacked devices, probably also monetized.
- Possible poisoning with strychnine, methanol, or similar; added maliciously to the water and air vents in my flat.
- Gaining private access to extremely personal information about me - including possible access to pedophile pornography made many decades ago - with the help of British citizens living in Dénia who had targeted me previously, and sharing this information with many people in the town in order to gain the whole town's support in persecuting me, and to justify further targeting, harassment, and terrorizing me, a lone and vulnerable woman with no support.

### Everyone knows who I am in Dénia

- If you travel to Dénia and talk to just a few people; ask them if they know me. They will answer in the affirmative. Most of these people I do not know.
- If you ask them why the whole town persecuted and terrorized me for 3 years, the answers will be quite interesting.
- Try and find someone who's seen footage of me naked, maybe masturbating, privately in my flat. They will be easy to find.
- Try and find someone who's seen footage of me as a child, sedated, being gang raped by a group of black men, and you may find someone who has seen it. You will certainly find many people who heard about it. Could this knowledge alone - without verification even - justify crucifying a lone vulnerable woman?
- What could anyone gain by torturing a lone woman in this way? We will find out in this report.
- How many other women have been targeted in a similar way?
- Were any of them murdered?
- How many of them ended up in porn or prostitution? This report reveals some real and some possible victims; all of the evidence sent to me by the hackers themselves.
- How many of them were minors, and how were thoses minors targeted for grooming?

!!! danger "My suffering"
    - See [Health](personal/health.md) for more information on health problems arising from 3 years of poisoning and drugging in Dénia.
    - See [Expenses](personal/expenses.md) for more information on the financial cost of enduring 3 years of gang stalking and mass gender violence by the people of Dénia.
    - See [Vocational](personal/vocational.md) for more information on the professional cost to me personally due to the stress and inability to make good decisions due to being targeted and terrorized, and drugged/poisoned continuously for 3 years in Dénia.

## Motive

I have spent much time theorizing on why a whole town would put so much energy into threatening and terrorizing a woman they considered vulnerable for over three years. Please see my [concluding theory](theories.md) for the main reason I believe I was targeted.

Besides that, my statement uncovers a dark underlying motive which relates everything that has happened to me over the last years in Spain to my experience of child sexual abuse at the hands of a pedophile rape gang in North London in 1989 who sedated me, gang raped me repeatedly, and filmed it without my knowledge; undoubtedly enriching themselves and others financially by doing so.

I have only become certain that this porn exists in the last couple of years via communication with the people of Dénia on my hacked devices. Prior to this, I had a suspicion that I had been filmed but not to the extend I was.

It transpires that the people of Dénia knew more about my life than I did. And they hated me for it too. They hated the victim of pedophiles at the request of the known pedophiles they respect and revere in the town.

I believe that, due to this horrible and secret information about me, teachers and staff at the conservatory of Dénia, their friends and family, and even my own "apparent" friends, were easily encouraged to participate in mass gang stalking, and it is probably something they've "always done" to uppity women they don't like or who are considered the justified victims of men; a sport, if you will, similar in nature to bullfighting. 

The end goal was my death; either by suicide, or murder.

However, whatever the criminals told the townsfolk and children, the ringleaders' underlying motive is always financial; in this case, initially, and maybe still, my money; then probably substantial earnings from spy-cam porn bolstered with the interest generated in the global and local porn-addict population with a taste for pedophilia, which is arguably epidemic right now. 

Given all these events have taken place within the context of studying at a public learning establishment, the Dénia music conservatory, which has in attendance hundreds of minor children, young people, and a handful of adults; and given the elaborate and extremely professional nature of the electronic attacks and the sophistication of the drugging techniques, the likelihood of similar things happening to others, including minors, must be taken into serious consideration.

One wonders if Dénia is simply a massive online porn studio; protected by corruption from top to bottom, where everyone has to do the bidding of the pornographers.

Are the people of Dénia prisoners in their own homes?

## Why was I in Dénia?

I love Dénia. 

I use to have many friends there and I sang in the International Choir for years. 

Studying the piano at the conservatory was an enormous privilege.

It is a special, magical place. 

I have always felt Dénia is my special, safe place. I had no idea that I had been targeted by criminals and porn gangs in Dénia since 2006. I had no idea of the ugly underbelly of this place, and the culture, and how women and children are particularly unsafe, even at public learning establishments.

In fact, I just wanted to play the piano and the standard of music teaching was second-to-none.

I hope that no-one else is going through the hell I have been enduring for years in Dénia that put me in constant fear for my life, but, most importantly, I want children, especially young girls, to be safe from sexual grooming for criminal purposes, i.e. early grooming for future involvement in porn and prostitution via normal daily activities like studying at public learning establishments in Spain.
