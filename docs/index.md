## Summary statement

This document details crimes against myself, Katharine Margaret Murphy, Y2775989H, currently residing at Carrer Furs 15, Bloque 1, Escalera 2, Piso 3, Apartamento 17, Dénia, 03700 Alicante Spain, that have taken place over the last three years since moving in on 15th December 2022.

The report details the following:

- Hacking of my home network, laptops - including work laptop - and mobile phones, most likely through direct access to my private home network via router MAC addresses.
- Cyber-stalking by teachers, staff, and others at the conservatory of Dénia, Spain; their friends and families and, closely connected to them, organized criminal gangs.
- Physical stalking, tracking my movements via hacked mobile phones, and possibly tracking on my car, in order to harass me and create intricate choreographed situations with the sole intention of terrorizing me.
- Sexual grooming and honey trapping online and in a public learning establishment, the conservatory of Dénia.
- Drugging/poisoning without my knowledge, in class at the conservatory, at home, in my car, and via access to my personal items, food, and toiletries, to continue the dosage while I was traveling away from Dénia for long periods.
- Taking photos and videos of me of a sexual nature, and otherwise, from hacked devices and/or hidden cameras, and disseminating them throughout Dénia, and likely making money from them on paid-for WhatsApp apps and/or porn networks.
- Mass voyeurism of myself through my hacked devices, probably also monetized.
- Possible poisoning with strychnine, methanol, or similar, added maliciously to the water and air vents in my flat.
- Gaining private access to extremely personal information about me, including possible access to pedophile pornography from many decades ago via British citizens living in Denia who had targeted me previously, and sharing this information with many people in the town in order to gain support in persecuting me and to justify further targeting, harassment, and terrorizing.

!!! danger
    - See [Health](personal/health.md) for more information on health problems arising from 3 years of poisoning and drugging in Denia.
    - See [Expenses](personal/expenses.md) for more information on the financial cost of enduring 3 years of gang stalking by the people of Denia.
    - See [Vocational](personal/vocational.md) for more information on the professional cost to me personally due to the stress and inability to make good decisions due to being targeted and terrorized, and drugged/poisoned continuously for 3 years.

### Motive

I have spent much time theorizing on why a whole town would put so much energy into threatening and terrorizing a woman they considered vulnerable for over two years. Please see my [concluding theory](theories.md) for the main reason I believe I was targeted.

Besides that, my statement uncovers a dark underlying motive which relates everything that has happened to me over the last years in Spain to my experience of child sexual abuse at the hands of a pedophile rape gang in North London in 1989 who put me in porn at that time.

I believe that teachers and staff, their friends and family, and even my own "apparent" friends, were easily encouraged to participate in mass gang stalking, and it is probably something they've "always done" to uppity women; a sport, if you will, similar in nature to bullfighting.

However, whatever the mob believe is going on, and whatever they told the children, the ringleaders' underlying motive is always financial; in this case, initially, and maybe still, my money; then probably substantial earnings from spy-cam porn bolstered with the interest generated in the global and local porn-addict population with a taste for pedophilia, which is arguably epidemic right now. 

Given all these events have taken place within the context of studying at a public learning establishment, the Dénia music conservatory, which has in attendance hundreds of minor children, and a handful of adults; and given the elaborate and extremely professional nature of the electronic attacks and the sophistication of the drugging techniques, the likelihood of similar things happening to others, including minors, must be taken into serious consideration.

### Why was I in Dénia

I love Denia. It is a special place and I have enjoyed living there over the years on three separate occasions. I returned in 2022 after being away, but always felt Denia was a special safe place. I had no idea that I was targeted and stalked by people in Denia since 2006. I had no idea of the seriously ugly underbelly of this place, and the culture, and how women and children are utterly unsafe, even at public learning establishments.

In fact, I just wanted to play the piano and the standard of music teaching was second-to-none.

I hope that no-one else goes through the hell I have been enduring for years in Dénia but, most importantly, I want children, especially young girls, to be safe from sexual grooming for criminal purposes, i.e. early grooming for future involvement in porn and prostitution via normal daily activities like studying at public learning establishments in Spain.
