# Summary statement

This document details the numerous crimes against myself, Katharine Margaret Murphy, of Carrer Furs 15, Bloque 1, Escalera 2, Piso 3, Apartamento 17, Dénia, 03700 Alicante Spain, that have taken place over the last years.

The report details the following:

- Hacking of my home network, laptops, including work laptop, and mobile phones.
- Cyber-stalking.
- Physical stalking, tracking my movements via hacked mobile phones, and possibly tracking on my car, in order to harass me and create intricate choreographed situations with the intention of unsettling and frightening me.
- Sexual grooming and honey trapping online and in a public learning establishment.
- Drugging without my knowledge, in class, at home, and otherwise.
- Taking photos and videos of me, of a sexual nature and otherwise, from hacked devices and/or hidden cameras, and disseminating them likely making money from them on porn networks.
- Mass voyeurism of myself through my hacked devices, probably also monetized.
- Possible poisoning with strychnine or similar added maliciously to the water in my flat.

Given all these events have taken place within the context of a public learning establishment, the Dénia music conservatory, which has in attendance hundreds of minor children, and a handful of adults; and given the elaborate and extremely professional nature of the electronic attacks, and the sophistication of the drugging techniques, the likelihood of similar things happening to others, including minors, must be taken into serious consideration.

## Motivation

For my part, I just want to play the piano. 

I also want no-one else to go through the hell I have been enduring for years in Dénia but, most importantly, I want children, especially young girls to be safe from sexual grooming for criminal purposes in public learning establishments in Spain.

This photo is me playing the piano as a student of the conservatory of Dénia in 2015.
