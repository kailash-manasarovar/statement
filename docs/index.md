## Summary statement

This document details the numerous crimes against myself, Katharine Margaret Murphy, of Carrer Furs 15, Bloque 1, Escalera 2, Piso 3, Apartamento 17, Dénia, 03700 Alicante Spain, that have taken place over the last years.

The report details the following:

- Hacking of my home network, laptops, including work laptop, and mobile phones.
- Cyber-stalking by teachers and staff at the conservatory of Dénia, Spain; their friends and families and, closely connected to them, organized criminal gangs.
- Physical stalking, tracking my movements via hacked mobile phones, and possibly tracking on my car, in order to harass me and create intricate choreographed situations with the intention of terrorizing me.
- Sexual grooming and honey trapping online and in a public learning establishment, the conservatory of Dénia.
- Drugging without my knowledge, in class at the conservatory, at home, in the car, and possibly elsewhere.
- Taking photos and videos of me of a sexual nature, and otherwise, from hacked devices and/or hidden cameras, and disseminating them throughout Dénia, and likely making money from them on paid-for WhatsApp apps and/or porn networks.
- Mass voyeurism of myself through my hacked devices, probably also monetized.
- Possible poisoning with strychnine or similar added maliciously to the water in my flat.

### Motive

My story will uncover a dark underlying motive which relates everything that has happened to me over the last years in Spain to my experience of child sexual abuse at the hands of a pedophile gang in North London in 1989 who put me in porn at that time.

I believe teachers and staff, their friends and family, were easily encouraged to participate in mass gang stalking and it is probably something they've "always done" to uppity women. 

However, the ringleaders' underlying motive, is always, of course, money; in this case money from porn and the likely huge interest generated in the global porn-addict population with a taste for pedophilia, which is arguably epidemic right now. 

Given all these events have taken place within the context of studying at a public learning establishment, the Dénia music conservatory, which has in attendance hundreds of minor children, and a handful of adults; and given the elaborate and extremely professional nature of the electronic attacks and the sophistication of the drugging techniques, the likelihood of similar things happening to others, including minors, must be taken into serious consideration.

### Why was I even in Dénia

I just wanted to play the piano.

I hope that no-one else goes through the hell I have been enduring for years in Dénia but, most importantly, I want children, especially young girls to be safe from sexual grooming for criminal purposes, i.e. early grooming for future involvement in porn and prostitution, or worse potentially, via studying at public learning establishments in Spain.
