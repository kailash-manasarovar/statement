# Summary statement

This document details the numerous crimes against myself, Katharine Margaret Murphy, of Carrer Furs 15, Bloque 1, Escalera 2, Piso 3, Apartamento 17, Dénia, 03700 Alicante Spain, that have taken place over the last years.

The report details the following:

- Hacking of my home network, laptops, including work laptop, and mobile phones.
- Cyber-stalking.
- Physical stalking, tracking my movements via hacked mobile and following me or creating situations in which I would find myself.
- Sexual grooming and honey trapping online.
- Drugging without my knowledge, in class at the conservatory, at home, and otherwise.
- Taking photos and videos of me, of a sexual nature and otherwise, from hacked devices and/or hidden cameras and disseminating them.
- Possible poisoning with strychnine in the water in my flat.

Given all these events have taken place within the context of a public learning establishment which has in attendance many hundreds of minor children, and a handful of adults, and given the elaborate and extremely professional nature of the electronic attacks, and the sophistication of the drugging techniques, the likelihood of similar things happening to others, including minors, must be taken into serious consideration.

## Motivation

For my part, I just want to play the piano. 

I also want no-one else to go through the hell I have been enduring for years in Dénia but, most importantly, I want children, especially young girls to be safe from sexual grooming for criminal purposes in public learning establishments.

This photo is me playing the piano as a student of the conservatory of Dénia in 2015.
