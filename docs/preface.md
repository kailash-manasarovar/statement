Dear reader,

This book started life as a police statement.

It was written under extraordinary pressures, and while the author was being poisoned and drugged by criminal gangs who had been terrorizing her for years, and had eventually tried to murder her because she was stubborn and blame-free, and refused to leave the apartment that she loved. 

Providence stepped in and she escaped to Bangkok where she would write her police statement.

People she had reached out to for help up to then couldn't help but be confused about what she was telling them as the story was so convoluted, so bizarre, and so much had happened, and she was so scared and anxious, and so many people were involved. 

Her story sounded like a Hollywood spy-action blockbuster; it was difficult to accept that this tiny, not-very-good-looking, soft-spoken, middle-aged woman could be the focus of so much hatred and so many criminal resources.

"It sounds like a chaos, doesn't it?", a Spanish government official had said. The same official advised her to write up a timeline of events and take it to the police.

The author knew she only had a short time to write down everything she knew about the murderous evil that has taken over the small, but important, town of Dénia on the east coast of Spain where the boats go back-and-forth each day to the Balearic islands.

In communication with the gangs online, the author found out that the evil had been in residence for decades, but it has only lately grown out of all proportion into something so hideous, so despicable, so egregious, no one is safe.

You might think the police would be keen to root out sex offending networks as quick as possible, particularly when their main targets have morphed from any single vulnerable female, or male with money, who might happenstance into the town and bump into an "introduction agent", into children and younger, and not necessarily just the foreign ones anymore.

But my requests for help were ignored. By the Spanish police three times, and by UK police numerous times too.

Why is anyone's guess.

If the people of Dénia have ceased to care for the safety and wellbeing of their own offspring, I, a child sexual abuse survivor myself, have not.

For that reason, the statement is now a book and I'm in the process of filling out the details from the skeleton draft I managed to author in Bangkok in November 2024.

Given I now have poetic license, the story is taking a new and more positive form. Ultimately, this book is a love story; a tale of good versus evil, a story of marriage and togetherness, and a strong commitment to truth, life, and the Light.

I hope my words bring healing. My words, I may have mentioned, are all I have.

And God. Of course.
