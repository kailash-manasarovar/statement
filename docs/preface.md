Dear reader,

This book started life as a police statement.

It was written under extraordinary pressures, and while the author was being poisoned, drugged, and terrorized by criminal sex gangs operating freely in Spanish public schools amongst minor children, teenagers, and young people.

![Terrorized by Spanish men and their female slaves](content/images/planning-the-murder-of-innocents-2.png)

The gangs had been stalking her for years, since at least 2003 when a [porn fatwa](timeline/early-years/2003.md#porn-fatwa) was issued against her as she was about to come into a *a lot* of money.

The gangs lured her to a beautiful town on the Spanish coast where they were free to do whatever they wanted to her, knowing she would never be able to escape or complain or get help. They eventually tried to murder her because she was stubborn and blame-free, and she refused to leave the town and people she loved when the porn-gangs had finished with her. 

Providence stepped in. She escaped to Bangkok where she wrote her police statement.

People she had reached out to for help up to then were confused about what she was telling them as the story was so convoluted, so bizarre, and so much had happened, and she was so scared and anxious, and so many people were involved. And also, because, no-one really cares about the horrors that women quietly endure.

Her story sounded like a Hollywood spy-action blockbuster. It was difficult to accept that this tiny, not-very-good-looking, soft-spoken, middle-aged, rather boring and sometimes very annoying British lady could be the focus of so much evil and loathing, and require so many criminal resources.

*"It sounds like a chaos, doesn't it?"*, a [Spanish government official had said](timeline/2024/october.md#madrid-and-paloma). The same official advised her to write up a timeline of events and take it to the police.

The author knew she only had a short time to write down everything she knew about the murderous evil that has taken over the small, but important, town of Dénia on the east coast of Spain where the boats go back-and-forth each day to the Balearic islands.

In communication with the gangs online, the author found out that the evil had been in residence for decades, but it has only lately grown out of all proportion into something so hideous, so despicable, so egregious; no one is safe, especially children.

So sure they were she would not survive - like *countless* others [including friends and family of the author herself](dedication.md) - they told her *all* their secrets, and she wrote them down.

A lioness had been waiting so long to emerge.

As the conspiracy's knots began to unravel, the author realized with horror that while she was living in her apartment in Dénia, set up with spy-cam and sedating tech, she had been the [Gisele Pelicot](timeline/early-years/2007.md#rewards-offered) of Spain.

Not only that, but every job this small, unassuming, quiet and intelligent computer scientist had done over that time was part of the same sedated porn conspiracy, particularly her job at [Spanish crypto firm Polygon](timeline/2023/november.md#polygon) but undoubtedly others too, and including the recruitment agents involved in getting her those jobs. The spidery tentacles of sex-offending at a Spanish public school, where students including children are regularly drugged by teachers, reached far and wide; perhaps right up to [Elon Musk himself](timeline/2023/june.md#elon).

You might think the police would be keen to root out sex offending networks as quick as possible, particularly when their main targets have morphed from single, wealthy and foreign, vulnerable females working in tech (or males given the right circumstances) into children and most likely babies too.

Yet targets have been happenstance wandering into the town for many decades, bumping into one of the numerous [*"introduction agents"*](crimes/introduction-agents.md) and ending up in rape porn, with or without their knowledge. One wonders how many complaints the police have buried over the years.  Certainly all the author's requests for help were silenced and ignored; by the Spanish police three times, and by UK police numerous times as well.

I suppose if the official protocol is to ignore and bury all complaints about serious sex offenses, and has been for decades, you might well be persuaded to join in.

Nevertheless, even if the people of Dénia have ceased to care for the safety and wellbeing of their own offspring, the author, a [child sexual abuse survivor herself](timeline/2023/november.md#first-time-they-flash-up-my-naked-16-year-old-body-on-x), has not.

For that reason, the statement is now a novel in production and the author is in the process of filling out the details from the skeleton draft she managed to put together in Bangkok in November 2024.

Given now she has poetic license, the story is taking a new and more positive form. 

Ultimately, this book is a love story; a tale of good versus evil, a story of marriage and communities coming together under a strong commitment to Truth, to Life, and to the Light.

I hope my words bring healing. My words, I may have mentioned, are all I have.

And God. Of Course. And God.
