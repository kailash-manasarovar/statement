## International choir concert

- I went to the international choir concert and met all my old pals.
- Paqui was there, my last piano teacher.
- It was a concert where all the old members were invited to go and sing again.
- Mercedes Correas had told me about it.
- I met Klara Sarkadi and she spoke to me in a concerned way.
- I got home that evening and got Covid.
- I was in bed for about 3 days.
- It battered my kidneys, I was really worried about my kidney health.
- When I managed to get out of bed, the weird communication continued on Twitter.

## Conservatory choir concert

- I was probably still infectious but I went to the conservatory choir concert nevertheless.
- I went masked up.
- I was thinking, with all this Twitter communication, he must talk to me, so I will go.
- He didn't talk to me.
- I was angry and posted an angry tweet about Domingo and his group of followers, and how it is extremely weird that they hang out with 14 year old girls.

## Next class

- When I went back to the conservatory for chamber music class the next Monday, the whole atmosphere had changed.
- Gloria threw her hands up at me at reception angrily.
- It was obvious everyone knew what I had said on Twitter.
- I thought the trumpet teacher must be telling everyone what I had said.
- It was all very disconcerting, and yet the physical vibrations got even stronger in class.
- I wanted to ask him if he felt it too.
- I was out of my mind.

## Acupuncture

- Acupuncture sessions started this month and the therapist is surprised I'm even alive from the state of my pulses.
- I explain that I've had some stress and my abuse history.
- I don't trust her. Something's not right with her.
- When I tell her I work in crypto, she grins that grin.
- I think she steals some paper money I have put in my mobile phone.
- When I'm on the table, I have the sensation she takes my bag out of the room and photographs my bank cards.

## TEB with Robin Sullivan

- I do Transformational Touch therapy with Robin Sullivan, the therapy that I do myself and have been learning in Ireland with Stephen Terrell, and I explain to her how I've been feeling, about this man, and my feelings for him.
- I detail the intensity of it, and also my kidney problems and when they began.
- I explain how I have never felt this way in my life. She remains unconvinced.
- I am clearly out of my mind.
- She can corroborate all this.
- In one of my sessions with Robin, he phones during the session.
