## Chamber music concert

- The trumpet teacher tells me that Pablo and I have to do a concert.
- It is originally arranged for the Casa de Cultura in the town, but then somehow it changes and it's going to be in the conservatory instead.
- I'm clear that I do not want to do this, and it is obvious he knows why (bullying). But I have to agree because it is a requirement of the course.
- On the day of the concert, there are myself and Pablo, and the autistic girl and the guitarist performing and a few parents.
- As I'm walking around to room 5 where the concert will take place in the conservatory building, Ana Girbes asks me, "are you alright?". I have no idea why she would ask me this.
- As we are preparing, Ana comes in significantly dressed up to the nines to put her instrument somewhere, same old weirdness.
- The trumpet teacher flirts with me outrageously in public. I flirt back. At one stage, our eyes lock, and there is a powerful and undeniably reciprocal sexual attraction which is rather overwhelming to both of us.
- The trumpet teacher heads to the back of the room, with his back to us, humming gently, for about 5 minutes, to collect himself.
- I sit as far away from him as possible in the room and he give me a wide birth too.
- I tweet about this later on, and other stuff as I tell my story on Twitter: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1759770318409695275.

!!! important
    - It's key to remember that this was the first man I had had any sexual feelings for since 2011.
    - Even though those feelings were mostly manipulated and manufactured, there was something real there, although it's not clear how much.
    - It was overwhelming.

## International choir concert

- I went to the international choir concert and met all my old pals.
- Paqui was there, my last piano teacher.
- It was a concert where all the old members were invited to go and sing again.
- Mercedes Correas had told me about it.
- I met Klara Sarkadi and she spoke to me in a concerned way.
- I got home that evening and got Covid.
- I was in bed for about 3 days.
- It battered my kidneys, I was really worried about my kidney health.
- When I managed to get out of bed, the weird communication continued on Twitter.

## Conservatory choir concert

- I was probably still infectious but I went to the conservatory choir concert nevertheless.
- I went masked up.
- I was thinking, with all this Twitter communication, he must talk to me, so I will go.
- He didn't talk to me.
- I was angry and posted an angry tweet about Domingo and his group of followers, and how it is extremely weird that the adult men amongst them hang out with 14 year old girls, that it's appalling he's able to get them to bully the choir teacher, etc.
- I tweeted that Domingo is "probably a trans woman".
- It really was my only transgression in all of this, and I deleted the tweet on June 12th.

## Next class

- When I went back to the conservatory for chamber music class the next Monday, the whole atmosphere had changed.
- Gloria threw her hands up at me at reception angrily.
- It was obvious everyone knew what I had said on Twitter.
- I thought the trumpet teacher must be telling everyone what I had said.
- It was all very disconcerting, and yet the physical vibrations got even stronger in class.
- I wanted to ask him if he felt it too.
- I was out of my mind.

## Acupuncture

- Acupuncture sessions started this month and the therapist is surprised I'm even alive from the state of my pulses.
- I explain that I've had some stress and my abuse history.
- I don't trust her. Something's not right with her.
- When I tell her I work in crypto, she grins that grin.
- I think she steals some paper money I have put in my mobile phone.
- When I'm on the table, I have the sensation she takes my bag out of the room and photographs my bank cards.

## TEB with Robin Sullivan

- I do Transformational Touch therapy with Robin Sullivan, the therapy that I do myself and have been learning in Ireland with Stephen Terrell, and I explain to her how I've been feeling, about this man, and my feelings for him.
- I detail the intensity of it, and also my kidney problems and when they began.
- I explain how I have never felt this way in my life. She remains unconvinced.
- I am clearly out of my mind.
- She can corroborate all this.
- In one of my sessions with Robin, he phones during the session.

## Twitter

- The curious interaction on Twitter between my own account and `@jctot19` continues.
- He posts something on his timeline, a pic, a meme, and it's clearly for me and I respond.
- One significant post was in regards to a favorite film.

![Man with headphones](../../content/tweets/man-with-headphones.JPG){width=45%}

- This is a film called [The Lives of Others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others) and is about the secret police listening into the resident's lives in East Germany. The irony was lost on me at the time.
