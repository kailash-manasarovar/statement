## Chamber music concert

- The trumpet teacher tells me that Pablo and I have to do a concert.
- It is originally arranged for the Casa de Cultura in the town, but then somehow it changes and it's going to be in the conservatory instead.
- I'm clear that I do not want to do this, and it is obvious he knows why (bullying). But I have to agree because it is a requirement of the course.
- On the day of the concert, there are myself and Pablo, and the autistic girl and the guitarist performing, and a few parents.
- As I'm walking around to room 5 where the concert will take place in the conservatory building, Ana Girbes asks me, "are you alright?". I have no idea why she would ask me this.

!!! danger "Critical update of 5th December 2024"
    - Domingo will have requested her to say this to me.
    - This was part of my police statement to the police in 2014 and Domingo and his associates will suspect this will upset me.
    - There are more of these events.

!!! danger "Critical update of 5th December 2024"
    - Just after posting this update. Commit no: [2370a8d](https://github.com/kailash-manasarovar/statement/commit/2370a8dc918f1d6d6a7b6ce3c9c3765965e03275) I feel like tweeting it so I do: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1864692459860893752
    - Immediately, no more than a minute later: 

    ![are you okay](../../content/images/are-u-okay.png)

- As we are preparing, Ana Requena comes in significantly dressed up to the nines to put her instrument somewhere, same old weirdness, in a different room.
- The trumpet teacher flirts with me outrageously in public. I flirt back. It's quite amusing.
- I remember I have cause to say, after he asks me about my surname and just after Ana has been in, that "Katharine is sufficient," and he giggles.
- At one stage, our eyes lock, and there is a powerful and undeniably reciprocal sexual attraction which is rather overwhelming to both of us.
- The trumpet teacher heads to the back of the room, with his back to us, humming gently, for about 5 minutes, to collect himself.
- I sit as far away from him as possible in the room, and he gives me a wide birth too.
- I tweet about this later on, and other stuff as I tell my story on Twitter: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1759770318409695275.

!!! important
    - It's key to remember that this was the first man I had had any sexual feelings for since 2011.
    - Even though those feelings were mostly manipulated and manufactured, there was something real there, although it's not clear how much.
    - It was overwhelming.

## International choir concert

- I went to the international choir concert and met all my old pals.
- Paqui Fornet Pastor was there, my last piano teacher at the conservatory, someone very much involved in the bullying although I wasn't to know.
- It was a concert where all the old members were invited to go and sing again.
- Mercedes Correas had told me about it.
- I met Klara Sarkadi and she spoke to me in a concerned way.
- I got home that evening and got Covid.
- I was in bed for about 3 days.
- It battered my kidneys. I was really worried about my kidney health.
- When I managed to get out of bed, the weird communication with the trumpet teacher continued on Twitter.

## Conservatory choir concert

- I was probably still infectious but I went to the conservatory choir concert nevertheless.
- I went masked up.
- I was thinking, with all this Twitter communication, he must talk to me, so I will go.
- He didn't talk to me.
- I was angry and posted an angry tweet about Domingo and his group of followers, and how it is extremely weird that the adult men are hanging out with 14 year old girls, that it's appalling he's able to get them to bully the choir teacher, etc.
- I tweeted that Domingo is "probably a trans woman".
- It really was my only transgression in all of this, but I was really angry. It was the only thing I felt at all guilty about, and only a tiny weeny bit. I was really only concerned that it might have upset Concha because I had mentioned her (not by name, no one by name).
- I deleted the tweet on June 12th.

## Next class

- When I went back to the conservatory for chamber music class the next Monday, the whole atmosphere had changed.
- Gloria threw her hands up at me at reception angrily.
- It was obvious everyone knew what I had said on Twitter.
- I thought the trumpet teacher must be telling everyone what I had said.
- It was all very disconcerting, and yet the physical vibrations got even stronger in class.
- I wanted to ask him if he felt it too.
- I was out of my mind.

### Harmony class that week

- I used to walk from the conservatory to the tunnel after harmony class with Samuel Viciano Herranz on the way home. We did that every class that school year 2022-2023.
- We would chat about stuff. His English was good.
- You may remember I told you he had been studying singing at [Javea conservatory](../2022/september.md#harmony) and had changed to do piano and study with Domingo and it was never really clear why. His singing voice was great and he was too old to be studying piano again.
- He was planning on becoming an English teacher. He kept telling me about the English teacher's course he was going to do over the summer online.
- He took pains to tell me how embarrassed he was his parents had paid for it.

!!! danger "Back handers?"
    - I really do wonder who paid for it now.
    - Did Samuel rearrange his whole life at Domingo's request so he could sit by me and talk to me in English every week at class.
    - Did Samuel require something in return for doing that.

- On this particular evening, we walked home together and he constantly texted on his WhatsApp, as if he was repeating everything I said to someone. Domingo of course.
- He also mentioned, bizarrely and repeatedly, a black man in a TV show and I believe he was referring to the `@AllyBrisket` account and suggesting it was Domingo.

!!! danger "Did the harmony teacher know I was being poisoned at home"
    - One class this month, the harmony teacher was marking homework. Only myself and Sofia Matyash Piyankova were at class.
    - The teacher, Adria Gil, was erratic and bizarrely behaved, as usual.
    - As he was marking my homework, he announced very loudly, "What happened Katharine? Usually your homework is really good but this is terrible, it's like it's not you. Were you angry?" (which was a piss-take thing to say).
    - I thought about it and I usually made tea and sat down to do my homework on a Sunday evening. I even remember this occasion as me not being able to get my thoughts straight at all and finding it very hard to concentrate and link ideas and chords.
    - I had to work on the keyboard visually as I wasn't able to imagine in my mind the keys, which was something I had no trouble with all my life.
    - I now wonder if Adria Gil knew I was being drugged/poisoned at home and was remarking on it.

## Acupuncture

- Acupuncture sessions started this month and the therapist is surprised I'm even alive from the state of my pulses.
- I explain that I've had some stress and my abuse history.
- I don't trust her. Something's not right with her.
- When I tell her I work in crypto, she grins that grin.
- I think she steals some paper money I have put in my mobile phone.
- When I'm on the table, I have the sensation she takes my bag out of the room and photographs my bank cards.
- I say things that make her surprised at my intuition and awareness.
- I tell her I believe I'm going to have a boyfriend soon.

## TEB with Robin Sullivan

- I do Transformational Touch therapy with Robin Sullivan, the therapy that I do myself and have been learning in Ireland with Stephen Terrell, and I explain to her how I've been feeling, about this man, and my feelings for him.
- I detail the intensity of it, and also my kidney problems and when they began.
- I explain how I have never felt this way in my life. She remains unconvinced and says let's leave that to one side.
- I am clearly out of my mind.
- She can corroborate all this.
- During one of my sessions with Robin, he phones me during the session, a missed call which I return.
- When I speak to him he is taking the piss. He keeps talking about having "double sessions" because he missed so many classes, but it is in an extremely weird way (pervy even) and he is trying not to laugh as if he has an audience.

## Twitter

- The curious interaction on Twitter between my own account and `@jctot19` continues.
- He posts something on his timeline, a pic, a meme, and it's clearly for me and I respond.
- One significant post was in regards to a favorite film.

![Man with headphones](../../content/tweets/man-with-headphones.JPG)

- This is a film called [The Lives of Others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others) and is about the secret police listening into the resident's lives in East Germany. The irony was lost on me at the time.
