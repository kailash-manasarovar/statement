## Chamber music concert

- A small concert is arranged. 
- We will play [Misty](march.md#piano-classes) and another rehearsal tune.
- The thought of everyone coming to a concert where myself and the trumpet teacher are in the same room, and with everything that's happened so far; the constant bullying, my feelings for him, how my whole body vibrates whenever I'm with him, the whole conservatory knowing something of my child sexual abuse history, because he told them, and him not speaking to me about any of it. It's all too much. 
- I'm clear with the trumpet teacher that I do not want to do it, but I have to agree because it is a requirement of the course.
- It feels like a set up; a trap. I'm right about this with no details.
- The concert is originally arranged for the [Casa de Cultura](https://www.denia.com/casa-de-cultura/) in the town.
- After my groans of complaint, the venue somehow changes and the concert will take place at the conservatory instead. 
- Myself and Pablo, and the autistic girl and her guitarist partner turn up to play.
- I am, as usual, euphoric, anxious, and high.
- We wait in the trumpet teaching room while he goes out (and conspires with the other teachers).
- When it's time to set up, we all walk around to the concert room 5 at the conservatory.
- Ana Girbes is standing outside her room which is on the way.
- As I pass her, she asks me loudly, "Are you alright?". 
- It's incongruous.
- I have no idea why she would ask me this.

!!! danger "Teachers repeat phrases from my police statement"
    - Someone told Ana to say this to me as I walked past her, and she did as she was told.
    - This came directly from my [statement to the police in 2015](../early-years/2015.md#statement-to-the-metropolitan-police) in which I detailed clear memories from that time, including things people had said to me.
    - This phrase, specifically, was something an old school friend had said to me when I was in a traumatized freeze state after smoking pot. 
    - I didn't know my police statement was being read by the original British porn and prostitution gangs themselves, and their Spanish counterparts in Dénia, and that a repeat of everything that had happened to me when I was 16 was being organized and choreographed for 2023.
    - On the run up to the 12th June 2023, when I was supposed to have been so terrorized I would leave my studies at the conservatory and never come back, these triggering events became more frequent.
    - We can only guess at what was originally intended for me beyond 12th June 2023.
    - Whatever it was, my actions ensured it didn't happen, and teachers and staff at the conservatory had to double down and continue terrorizing me on into the following study year.

!!! danger "Further confirmation in December 2024?"
    - Just after posting this update: commit no: [2370a8d](https://github.com/kailash-manasarovar/statement/commit/2370a8dc918f1d6d6a7b6ce3c9c3765965e03275), I feel like tweeting it so I do: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1864692459860893752

    ![police statement tweet](../../content/tweets/police-statement.png)

    - A few moments later: 

    ![are you okay](../../content/images/are-u-okay.png)

- As we are setting up the concert, Ana Requena comes in again with her instrument, this time dressed up like she's going out; same old contrived weirdness.
- The trumpet teacher flirts with me outrageously in public. I flirt back. It's quite amusing.
- I remember I have cause to say, after he asks me about my surname, and just after Ana has been in, that "Katharine is sufficient," and he giggles. He primes this, of course.
- At one stage, our eyes lock, and there is a powerful and undeniably reciprocal sexual attraction which is rather overwhelming to both of us.
- The trumpet teacher heads to the back of the room, with his back to us, humming gently, for about 5 minutes, to collect himself.
- I sit as far away from him as possible in the room. I don't look at him, and he gives me a wide birth too.
- The sexual arousal I have for this man is overpowering.
- I tweet about this later on, and other key evidence as I tell my story on X: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1759770318409695275. 
- Eventually the concert begins and is successful, although I hear the trumpet teacher instructing Pablo to mess up on the Misty tune.

- It's interesting to see how much of the conspiracy I had figured out by February 2024 when I posted this, it wasn't much. I still hadn't realized I was being drugged continuously.
- The two Ana's (violin teacher and musical language teacher) make a great fuss of pretending that Ana the violin teacher is terribly jealous and angry with me for posting this information on X in February 2024.

## Concert de Orfeo de Dénia

- The choir I used to sing in, the Orfeo de Dénia, gave a [concert to celebrate 40 years of activity](https://www.denia.com/el-orfeo-de-denia-celebra-sus-40-anos-con-un-emotivo-concierto-que-unio-varias-generaciones-de-coristas/).
- Mercedes had told me about it at my piano classes.
- I went along and met some of my old pals. It was really wonderful to see them again.

![The international choir concert](../../content/images/coro-con-klari.webp)

- [Paqui Fornet Pastor](../../crimes/protagonists.md#paqui-fornet-pastor) was there, my final piano teacher at the conservatory when I eventually left in fear of my life in March 2024; someone very much involved in the conspiracy and gang-stalking although I couldn't have known that at the time.
- I saw Klara Sarkadi, the choir master, for the first time in nearly 10 years and we chatted for a while. 
- She spoke to me in a concerned way. She seemed nervous. Her mouth was dry and she kept tripping up on her words.
- Klara Sarkadi is a good friend of Domingo Cano. She has known him for years. She would ask me about him, what I thought of him and similar, back in [2014 when I first had classes with him](../early-years/2014.md#first-piano-class-at-the-end-end-of-september). I didn't realize she was reporting back.
- Klara has more recently been studying to be an orchestral conductor at the superior conservatory of Alicante.

![Klara Sarkadi linkedin](../../content/images/klara-sarkadi.png)

- One wonders how she managed to get all that ['enchufe'](https://crossidiomas.com/tener-enchufe/) in the conservatory system? The same public school system which is actively sexually grooming students and attempting to murder anyone who complains.
- Looking back, Klari's demeanor towards me at that time spoke volumes about her close relationship to Domingo and what *she knew* was going on for me at that time.
- I got home that evening and got Covid.
- I was in bed for about 3 days.
- Covid battered my kidneys. I was really worried about my kidney health.
- When I managed to get out of bed, the weird communication with the trumpet teacher continued on Twitter.

## Conservatory choir concert

- I was probably still infectious but I went to the conservatory choir concert nevertheless.
- I went masked up.
- I was thinking, with all this Twitter communication, he must talk to me, so I will go.
- I saw him in the audience.
- He didn't talk to me.
- Nacho the clarinet teacher, close friend of Domingo Cano, stares at me and laughs like a hyena.
- I was angry and posted an angry tweet about Domingo and his group of followers, and how it is extremely weird that the adult men are hanging out with 14 year old girls, that it's appalling he's able to get them to bully the choir teacher, etc.
- I tweeted that Domingo is "probably a trans woman".
- It really was my only transgression in all of this, but I was really angry. It was the only thing I felt at all guilty about, and only a tiny weeny bit. I was really only concerned that it might have upset Concha because I had mentioned her (not by name, no one by name).
- I deleted the tweet on June 12th.

## Possums

- It was around this time I started to see Twitter posts related to possums. All the time.
- Daily possum, Day of the possum, all sorts.
- I have no interest in possums. I find them quite ugly.
- This continues until October 2024 when I find out why.
- It transpires that all these posts about possums that I see are specifically rendered on my account feed via root access to my machine.

## Next class

- When I went back to the conservatory for chamber music class the next Monday, the whole atmosphere had changed.
- Gloria threw her hands up at me at reception angrily.
- It was obvious everyone knew what I had said on Twitter.
- I thought the trumpet teacher must be telling everyone what I had said.
- It was all very disconcerting, and yet the physical vibrations got even stronger in class.
- I wanted to ask him if he felt it too.
- I was out of my mind.

### Harmony class that week

- I used to walk from the conservatory to the tunnel after harmony class with Samuel Viciano Herranz on the way home. We did that every class that school year 2022-2023.
- We would chat about stuff. His English was good.
- You may remember I told you he had been studying singing at [Javea conservatory](../2022/september.md#harmony) and had changed to do piano and study with Domingo and it was never really clear why. His singing voice was great and he was too old to be studying piano again.
- He was planning on becoming an English teacher. He kept telling me about the English teacher's course he was going to do over the summer online.
- He took pains to tell me how embarrassed he was his parents had paid for it.

!!! danger "Back handers?"
    - I really do wonder who paid for it now.
    - Did Samuel rearrange his whole life at Domingo's request so he could sit by me and talk to me in English every week at class.
    - Did Samuel require something in return for doing that.

- On this particular evening, we walked home together and he constantly texted on his WhatsApp, as if he was repeating everything I said to someone. Domingo of course.
- He also mentioned, bizarrely and repeatedly, a black man in a TV show and I believe he was referring to the `@AllyBrisket` account and suggesting it was Domingo.

!!! danger "Did the harmony teacher know I was being poisoned at home"
    - One class this month, the harmony teacher was marking homework. Only myself and Sofia Matyash Piyankova were at class.
    - The teacher, Adria Gil, was erratic and bizarrely behaved, as usual.
    - As he was marking my homework, he announced very loudly, "What happened Katharine? Usually your homework is really good but this is terrible, it's like it's not you. Were you angry?" (which was a piss-take thing to say).
    - I thought about it and I usually made tea and sat down to do my homework on a Sunday evening. I even remember this occasion as me not being able to get my thoughts straight at all and finding it very hard to concentrate and link ideas and chords.
    - I had to work on the keyboard visually as I wasn't able to imagine in my mind the keys, which was something I had no trouble with all my life.
    - I now wonder if Adria Gil knew I was being drugged/poisoned at home and was remarking on it.

## Acupuncture

- Acupuncture sessions started this month and the therapist is surprised I'm even alive from the state of my pulses, especially my kidneys.
- I explain that I've had some stress and my abuse history.
- I don't trust her. Something's not right with her.
- When I tell her I work in crypto, she grins that grin.
- I think she steals some paper money I have put in my mobile phone.
- When I'm on the table, I have the sensation she takes my bag out of the room and photographs my bank cards.
- I say things that make her surprised at my intuition and awareness.
- I tell her I believe I'm going to have a boyfriend soon.

## TEB with Robin Sullivan

- I do Transformational Touch therapy with Robin Sullivan, the therapy that I do myself and have been learning in Ireland with Stephen Terrell, and I explain to her how I've been feeling, about this man, and my feelings for him.
- I detail the intensity of it, and also my kidney problems and when they began.
- I explain how I have never felt this way in my life. She remains unconvinced and says let's leave that to one side.
- I am clearly out of my mind.
- She can corroborate all this.
- During one of my sessions with Robin, he phones me during the session, a missed call which I return.
- When I speak to him he is taking the piss. He keeps talking about having "double sessions" because he missed so many classes, but it is in an extremely weird way (pervy even) and he is trying not to laugh as if he has an audience.

!!! danger "Double sessions"
    - Looking back, this sort of thing suggests that indeed they are sedating me and coming into my flat to sexually assault me, film it, and monetize it on porn networks.

## Twitter

- The curious interaction on Twitter between my own account and `@jctot19` continues.
- He posts something on his timeline, a pic, a meme, and it's clearly for me and I respond.
- One significant post was in regards to a favorite film.

![Man with headphones](../../content/tweets/man-with-headphones.JPG)

- This is a film called [The Lives of Others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others) and is about the secret police listening into the resident's lives in East Germany. The irony was lost on me at the time.
