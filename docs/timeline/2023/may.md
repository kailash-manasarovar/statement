## International choir concert

- I went to the international choir and met all my old pals
- Klara Sarkadi spoke to me in a way which seemed like she was concerned
- I got home and got covid
- When I got out of bed the tweeting and feelings continued

## Choir concert

- I was out of action for a few days but I wanted to go to the choir concert in any case
- I went masked up
- I thought he must talk to me so I will go
- He didn't talk to me
- I was angry and posted an angry tweet about Domingo and his group of followers and how they hang out with 14 year old girls

## Next class

- When I went back to the conservatory, the whole atmosphere had changed
- Gloria threw her hands up at me at reception
- It was obvious everyone knew what I had said on Twitter
- I thought Vidal must be telling everyone what I had said
- It was all very disconcerting, and yet the vibrating got even stronger in class

## Acupuncture

- Acupuncture sessions start this month and the therapist is surprised I'm even alive from my pulses
- I explain that I've had some stress and my history 
- I don't trust her
- When I tell her I work in crypto she grins that grin
- I think she steals money from my mobile phone
- When I'm on the table, I have the sensation she takes my bag out of the room and photographs my bank cards

## TEB with Robin Sullivan

- I do therapy with Robin Sullivan and explain how I'm feeling.
- I explain also how I believe I am in love and this strange business is going on.
- I explain how I have never felt this way in my life. She remains unconvinced.
- I am clearly out of my mind.
