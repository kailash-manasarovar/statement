## Mental state and health concerns

- I can't stop thinking about this man the trumpet teacher, my mind is racing with thoughts about him.
- I'm extremely concerned about rhabdo and having kidney damage.
- I go on a very strict kidney diet to try to heal myself.
- I start to lose a lot of weight but I manage to stop the froth in my urine which is exacerbated with dairy and albumin intake.
- I contact an acupuncturist in Dénia to ask for help: https://www.thaoqi.com/.
- She is not back in town until May so she can't see me for a few months.
- I go to see a homeopath in Dénia, Ana Villalba. I'm not sure I trust her. 
- Each time I see her she wants to hear about my abuse story, and not in a kind way.

## PTSD

- Classes continue and I believe I'm in love with the trumpet teacher.

!!! tip "Disclaimer"
    - I'm always in love with someone.
    - It's never very serious.

- However, whenever I'm in class with him my whole body vibrates. 
- I have never felt like this before in my life and I reiterate that in many written messages to people while I had no idea what was going on. 
- He starts to talk to me at one class, and I have a severe PTSD reaction where I become scared and I'm not able to talk to him.
- Back at home I'm upset about this because it has caused me problems all my life.
- The irony is it was actually alarm bells.
- I believe he likes me and I'm devastated I cannot respond.

## Observations on the trumpet teacher

- The trumpet teacher seems poor and he is badly dressed.
- He seems like a desperate man somehow.
- Of the few classes he does turn up to, there are one or two where he appears to be wearing a prison-issue shirt.
- I bring in a lot of the music we study, and he goes to photocopy it, sometimes he takes a long time doing so.
- When he returns, I notice that he holds the pages in the top corner only.

## Ana the violin teacher

- The choreographed torment includes the suggestion that the trumpet teacher and Ana are having a romantic liaison.
- Ana comes in every class with her instrument to put it in the room, for reasons unclear.
- Ana and Rosa María Vidal Orengo come in together sometimes with instruments which they leave in this room.
- It's all very contrived.
- Rosa is the vice director of the conservatory.
- On one occasion, Rosa mentions to the trumpet teacher that it is his *funcionario* exam the following week.
- I understood from things that Maria and Vidal had said, that he was sitting the exam to become eligible for a pension.
- Vidal is often practicing for his exam when I arrive at class and he says so.
- It's all a bit contrived.

!!! tip "List of teachers and staff"
    The current lists on the conservatory website may still reflect the state of the staff in 2023 although there will be changes.

## Other times

- I also find myself light-headed in other classes like choir
- Looking back I was completely out of my mind and I had no idea I was
- I was being spiked and had been from at least December 2022
