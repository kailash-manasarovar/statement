# February 2023

## Mental state and health concerns

- I can't stop thinking about this man, the trumpet teacher. My mind is racing with thoughts about him.
- I excessively plan novel after novel about our romantic adventures in my head! 
- I'm extremely concerned about rhabdo and having kidney damage.
- I consider my GP to be ineffective.
- I go on a very strict kidney diet to try to heal myself.
- I start to lose a lot of weight but I manage to stop the froth in my urine which is exacerbated with any dairy or albumin intake.
- I contact an acupuncturist in Dénia to ask for help: https://www.thaoqi.com/.
- She is not back in town until May so she can't see me for a few months.
- I go to see a homeopath in Dénia, Ana Villalba. I'm not sure I trust her.
- Each time I see her she wants to hear about my child sexual abuse story, and not in a kind way. I feel like I'm being interrogated.
- Each time I see her she mentions her patients who have freed themselves of domestic violence.
- She prescribes drops to take every day which I collect from the Romany pharmacy in Dénia.
- She takes copious written notes.
- She asks me to phone her regularly. I explain I'm uncomfortable speaking on the phone in Spanish.

## A scan at the medical centre

- I go for a scan at the medical centre because I'm so concerned about my kidney health.
- The doctor who does the scan - and this is no exaggeration - looks in the air while he puts the ultra sound on my stomach and moves it around quickly.
- He doesn't look at the screen at all.
- It's all over in about 2 minutes and he says I'm fine.

## PTSD

- Classes continue and I believe I'm in love with the trumpet teacher.

!!! tip "Disclaimer"
    - I'm always in love with someone.
    - It's never very serious.

- However, whenever I'm in class with him my whole body vibrates. 
- I have never felt like this before in my life and I reiterate that in many written messages to people while I had no idea what was going on. 
- He starts to take interest in me at one class and ask me questions about my life. I have a severe PTSD reaction - due to child sexual abuse - where I become scared and I'm not able to talk to him without being rude.
- Back at home I'm upset about this because this reaction has caused me problems all my life.
- The irony is the reaction was genuine alarm bells.
- I'm not aware of this at that time, however, and I believe he likes me and I'm devastated I cannot respond to him normally.

## Gang stalking at the conservatory and the promise of a relationship

- The trumpet teacher flirts with me whenever I go to class.
- I'm extremely high at class, flushed and excited, vibrating, and I find the man who takes the class exceedingly and overwhelmingly attractive.
- Situations happen around the conservatory which seem to indicate there is a bit of gossip going on about a possible relationship. The male teachers are always excited around me, running to see me when I'm in other classes, pointing and laughing. I mention a lot of this activity in my [letters to the Generalitat](october.md#first-letter-to-the-generalitat) and elsewhere.
- At one chamber music class, I don't remember which one, the trumpet teacher suggests he is free in the afternoons and the implication is that we could maybe get together.
- For me, this is a bit much. I haven't had sexual relations for nearly 13 years, and I haven't had a proper boyfriend for over 20 years. I don't reply.

!!! danger
    - Was this an attempt to commence a regular sexual relationship with me at my apartment which could then be live-streamed on porn networks?

## Observations on the trumpet teacher

- The trumpet teacher seems poor and he is badly dressed.
- He seems like a desperate man somehow. I wonder if he takes drugs. He doesn't smell of smoke.
- Of the few classes he does turn up to, in some of the earlier classes he appears to be wearing a prison-issue shirt.
- I bring in a lot of the music we study, and he goes to photocopy it. Gloria will be helping him no doubt. Sometimes he takes a long time doing the photocopying.
- When he returns, I notice that he holds the pages he gives me in the top corner only. 

!!! tip "Bait and switch"
    - Could these moments, whenever he leaves the class to go to the photocopier, or perhaps when he [goes downstairs with the doctor](january.md#serious-poisoning-at-chamber-music-class) be when different men switch over?
    - When I think back on the men that took the trumpet teacher role, there seemed to be a soft spoken one who I had genuinely good feelings about, and a brash and violent one who made me feel nervous and afraid. 
    - Could these two have been the same person? 
    - When I look at the [men in the trumpet-teacher photos](../../crimes/protagonists.md#vidal-sastre-sanchez-hornero), I don't remember having good feelings for him/them.
    - When I think back, I remember a slighter man at class, with a physique I found attractive.
    - And then, I also remember that the man who came to class was a large lumbering man, with extremely muscular forearms.

- Sometimes he asks me about something on his phone and hands me his phone so I'm holding it. It's never clear what he wants.

!!! info "What I thought he might have wanted"
    - When I realized I had been targeted by criminal gangs, I had a theory that he was getting me to touch his phone so he could record my fingerprints for future theft.
    - I now wonder if also perhaps he had some substance on the phone screen that he wanted me to touch and absorb through my skin.
    - Was he ingesting whatever it was he was spiking me with too, but of his own accord?

- His hands are small and his fingers thin and delicate.

### Plot awareness

- Whatever drugs they were giving me made me extremely and unusually aware of hidden things going on, plots and subplots.
- Of course, I knew about the plot with Domingo, and what was coming up (a 'funeral' of some sort which I really didn't care about) so my experience of the classes were tainted with this knowledge.
- And, at the same time, I had such a good feeling for this man, I had only generous views of him. I felt he must be on my side.
- In one class, the three of us are sitting close together and practicing, and the trumpet teacher announces that we will play *My Way* for the concert.
- I chuckle conspiratorially.
- The man gets angry. He jumps up and starts interrogating me and all the answers I give him make him even more enraged.
- I tell him I was joking. It's rather funny. 
- Pablo and I look at each other and shrug. We have no idea what got into him.

## Ana the violin teacher

- Teachers and staff at the conservatory put enormous effort into trying to convince me that the trumpet teacher and Ana Requena Marín, the violin teacher, were having a romantic liaison.
- This included constant choreographed events, in the conservatory and around town, that were designed to torment and upset me.
- All choreographed events relied upon constant knowledge of my whereabouts which they could only have had with access to my mobile activity.
- These ideas were reinforced online with subliminal suggestions and NLP, and this was further reinforced with things other people might say or do.
- The Ana lie started at the first class when the trumpet teacher [bumps into her](../2022/november.md#the-trumpet-teacher) outside the toilet next to the classroom, and I am high and euphoric at that moment having been successfully spiked with some kind of psychoactive mood-altering substance.
- As this lie progressed, Ana interrupts every chamber music class for a few minutes to bring her instrument and leave it in the room, for reasons unclear, something that never happens normally.
- Ana and Rosa María Vidal Orengo come in together sometimes to do this.
- It's all very contrived. 
- Rosa is the vice director of the conservatory.
- On one occasion, Rosa mentions to the trumpet teacher not to forget that it is his *funcionario* exam the following week.
- I understood that to mean he was sitting the exam to become eligible for a pension, and whenever I arrive at class, the trumpet teacher is often practicing for his exam and he says so.
- On one occasion, he mentions that he "needs to pay for his daughters' weddings".

!!! tip "List of teachers and staff at the conservatory"
    - The current lists on the conservatory website may still reflect the state of the staff in 2023 although there will be changes.
        - Teachers: https://portal.edu.gva.es/conservatoridenia/es/departaments-es/
        - Staff: https://portal.edu.gva.es/conservatoridenia/es/centro/organigrama/

- The "Ana is his girlfriend" lie was particularly vicious and, even though I really didn't care, it upset me as intended because it was relentless, and I believed I was in love, and the feeling was overpowering even if false.
- During the cyber stalking to come, aside from there being a host of pictures of [Ana Requena modeling](../../content/images/fake-accounts/GZ69WCMXQAEQdzB.png) and constant sexual and other derogatory references to her, there is also an interesting picture of the child catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

![child catcher](../../content/images/ana-children.png)

- This is a picture I viewed some time in 2022, retweeted and never looked at again. However, it appeared on manipulated [Google search results](../../evidence/google-searches.md) continuously, up until even August 2024, when the stalkers started going on about Ana again.
- The inference is supposed to be that Ana has locked away the trumpet teacher's children and so he can't free himself from her to be with me.
- The lies evolved into Ana is pregnant with his child.
- The Ana theme was repeated endlessly over fake account messages, and by Ana herself at the conservatory.
- The lie and their dedication to it was extraordinary. 
- I can only assume they were really enjoying terrorizing me.

## Feeling high at other times too

- I also find myself light-headed and euphoric in other classes, including choir and harmony class.
- Looking back, I can see that I was completely out of my mind during this time, and I had no idea that I was being drugged.
- I was being medicated without my knowledge, and I believe this had been going on from at least December 2022 at the conservatory itself.
- The drugging was most intense during the chamber music classes where a trumpet teacher was physically present, but I was experiencing this elsewhere too.
- When the criminal's plans didn't work out for them as they had hoped, and I continued turning up for music classes, the drugging became more intense.

## Unintended consequences of drugging an adult person without their knowledge

- I am a yoga practitioner and have done huge amounts of meditation and intense spiritual practices over the years.
- My practices have made me extremely sensitive, including physically, which is possibly why the dose of [whatever they gave me the month previously](january.md#serious-poisoning-at-chamber-music-class) had such a dramatic and traumatic effect on my system.
- Another of my favorite spiritual yoga practices is bhakti yoga devotion, where you worship God in all His forms.
- Around this time, I started to become obsessed with Hanuman, the monkey god from the Hindu religion.

![Hanuman RAM RAM](../../content/images/hanuman.jpg)

- I have adored Hanuman for many years because he loves and protects women and children.
- He is the number one yogi.
- I can't remember what started it, but around this time it was as if he was everywhere around me. 
- I couldn't stop thinking about him either.
- Thinking back, something similar had happened in 2015 in Dénia too.
- I subscribed to an Indian TV show of 630-odd episodes about his childhood and his relationship with Ram: https://www.sonyliv.com/shows/sankatmochan-mahabali-hanuman-1700000109.
- I created little videos that I found delightful and put them on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/jack.chardwood.3/videos.
- I put Hanuman music on my phone and alarm clock.
- I bought or made t-shirts with him on them and wore them to chamber music class to feel safer.
- I was truly obsessed with Hanuman; and I still am, but not to the extent I was during 2023.
- I became a devotee.

!!! tip "Who is Hanuman?"
    - Hanuman is a major player in the Hindu epic the Ramayana.
    - He helps save Ram, Sita, and Lakshman from the evil demon Ravana.
    - He rescues Sita from Ravana who had kidnapped her and taken her to Sri Lanka.
    - Consequently, Hanuman is known for protecting women from evil men.

    ![Lord Hanuman miracles](../../content/images/lord-hanuman-miracles.jpg)

- Even [my alarm](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Fohbs4oCy6qU2rnG40F3blPJ6TheJL9/view?usp=sharing) that I listened to every morning to wake me up was a devotional prayer from Hanuman to Ram.

## Silvia

- People keep saying a name so that I can hear it, Silvia.
- Maria and Porsche say it meaningfully and look at me closely at piano class.
- I hear the name everywhere, I don't know why.

!!! info "Who is Silvia?"
    - To this day I don't know who or what Silvia refers to.
    - There have been numerous suggestions online about it such as:
        - Silvia is a trans identified young girl at the conservatory.
        - Silvia is one of the trumpet teacher's daughters who is being targeted by the porn gangs so he can pay a debt back.
        - Other nonsensical stories.
        - Who knows? Perhaps just a trigger to create more stress and anxiety in my mind. 
        - Probably just the trumpet teacher's wife, but which trumpet teacher, and does anyone even care?
    - I tweeted about this Silvia lie a fair bit: https://x.com/search?q=silvia%20(from%3A1frgvn)&src=typed_query&f=live
