## PTSD

- Classes continue and I believe I'm in love with Vidal
- Whenever I'm in class my whole body vibrates. I have never felt like this before in my life and I reiterate that in many messages while I had no idea what was going on. I of course put it down to love
- He starts to talk to me at one class and I have a severe PTSD reaction of getting scared and not being able to talk to him
- Back at home I'm upset about this because it has caused me problems all my life
- The irony is it was actually alarm bells
- I realise/believe he likes me

## Ana

- Somehow the suggestion is that he and Ana are an item.
- Ana comes in every class with her instrument to put it in the room, for reasons unclear.
- Ana and Rosa come in together sometimes.
- Rosa is the head of studies.
- On one occasion, Rosa mentions to Vidal that it is his *funcionario* exam the following week.
- I understood from things that Maria and Vidal had said, that he was sitting the exam to become eligible for a pension.
- Vidal is often practicing for his exam when I arrive at class and he says so.
- It's all a bit contrived.

## Other times

- I also find myself light-headed in other classes like choir
- Looking back I was completely out of my mind and I had no idea I was
- I was being spiked and had been from at least December 2022
