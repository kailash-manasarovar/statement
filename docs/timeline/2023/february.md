# February 2023

## Mental state and health concerns

- I can't stop thinking about this man, the trumpet teacher. My mind is racing with thoughts about him.
- I'm extremely concerned about rhabdo and having kidney damage.
- I go on a very strict kidney diet to try to heal myself.
- I start to lose a lot of weight but I manage to stop the froth in my urine which is exacerbated with dairy and any albumin intake.
- I contact an acupuncturist in Dénia to ask for help: https://www.thaoqi.com/.
- She is not back in town until May so she can't see me for a few months.
- I go to see a homeopath in Dénia, Ana Villalba. I'm not sure I trust her.
- Each time I see her she wants to hear about my child sexual abuse story, and not in a kind way. Each time I see her she mentions domestic violence.
- She prescribes drops to take every day which I collect from the Romany pharmacy in Dénia.

## A scan at the medical centre

- I go for a scan at the medical centre because I'm so concerned about my kidney health.
- The doctor who does the scan - no exaggeration - looks in the air while he puts the ultra sound thing on my stomach and moves it around quickly.
- He doesn't look at the screen at all.
- It's all over in about 2 minutes and he says I'm fine.

## PTSD

- Classes continue and I believe I'm in love with the trumpet teacher.

!!! tip "Disclaimer"
    - I'm always in love with someone.
    - It's never very serious.

- However, whenever I'm in class with him my whole body vibrates. 
- I have never felt like this before in my life and I reiterate that in many written messages to people while I had no idea what was going on. 
- He starts to take interest in me at one class and ask me questions about my life. I have a severe PTSD reaction - due to child sexual abuse - where I become scared and I'm not able to talk to him without being rude.
- Back at home I'm upset about this because it has caused me problems all my life.
- The irony is it was actually alarm bells.
- In any case, I believe he likes me and I'm devastated I cannot respond.

## Gang stalking at the conservatory and the promise of a relationship

- The trumpet teacher flirts with me whenever I go to class.
- I'm extremely high at class and find him exceedingly and overwhelmingly attractive.
- Situations happen around the conservatory which seem to indicate there is a bit of gossip going on about a possible relationship. The men are always excited around me. I mention a lot of this in my [letters to the Generalitat](october.md#first-letter-to-the-generalitat) and elsewhere.
- At one chamber music class, I don't remember which one, the trumpet teacher suggests he is free in the afternoons and the implication is that we could maybe get together.
- For me, this is a bit much. I haven't had sexual relations for nearly 13 years, and I haven't had a proper boyfriend for over 20 years. I don't reply.

!!! danger
    - I now believe this was an attempt to commence a regular sexual relationship with me at my apartment which would then be live-streamed on porn networks.

## Observations on the trumpet teacher

- The trumpet teacher seems poor and he is badly dressed.
- He seems like a desperate man somehow. I wonder if he takes drugs. He doesn't smell of smoke.
- Of the few classes he does turn up to, in some of the earlier classes he appears to be wearing a prison-issue shirt.
- I bring in a lot of the music we study, and he goes to photocopy it. Gloria will be helping him no doubt. Sometimes he takes a long time doing the photocopying.
- When he returns, I notice that he holds the pages he gives me in the top corner only. 

!!! tip "Bait and switch"
    - Could these moments, whenever he left the class to go to the photocopier, be the time when the two men switched over?

- Sometimes he asks me about something on his phone and hands me his phone so I'm holding it. It's never clear what he wants.

!!! info "What I thought he might have wanted"
    - When I realized I had been targeted by criminal gangs, I had a theory that he was getting me to touch his phone so he could record my fingerprints.
    - I now think that perhaps he had some substance on the phone screen that he wanted me to touch and therefore ingest.
    - I wonder now also if he was ingesting whatever it was he was giving me but of his own accord.

## Ana the violin teacher

- The choreographed torment includes the suggestion that the trumpet teacher and Ana Requena Marín are having a romantic liaison.
- Ana comes into classroom every chamber music class with her instrument to leave it in the room, for reasons unclear, something that never happens normally.
- Ana and Rosa María Vidal Orengo come in together sometimes with instruments which they leave in this room.
- It's all very contrived.
- Rosa is the vice director of the conservatory.
- On one occasion, Rosa mentions to the trumpet teacher that it is his *funcionario* exam the following week.
- I understood that he was sitting the exam to become eligible for a pension and whenever I arrive at class, the trumpet teacher is often practicing for his exam and he says so.
- On one occasion, he mentions that he "needs to pay for his daughter's weddings".

!!! tip "List of teachers and staff"
    - The current lists on the conservatory website may still reflect the state of the staff in 2023 although there will be changes.
        - Teachers: https://portal.edu.gva.es/conservatoridenia/es/departaments-es/
        - Staff: https://portal.edu.gva.es/conservatoridenia/es/centro/organigrama/

- The "Ana is his girlfriend" lie was particularly vicious and, even though I really didn't even care, it upset me as intended because it was relentless and I believed I was in love and it was an overpowering feeling.
- During the cyber stalking to come, aside from there being a host of pictures of [Ana Requena modeling](../../content/images/fake-accounts/GZ69WCMXQAEQdzB.png) and constant sexual and other derogatory references to her, there is also an interesting picture of the child catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

![child catcher](../../content/images/ana-children.png)

- This is a picture I viewed some time in 2022, retweeted and never looked at again. However, it appeared continuously up until even August 2024 when the stalkers started going on about Ana again.
- The inference is supposed to be that Ana has locked away the trumpet teacher's children and so he can't free himself from her to be with me.
- This theme was repeated endlessly over fake account messages and by Ana herself at the conservatory.

## Other times

- I also find myself light-headed and high in other classes, including choir and harmony class.
- Looking back, I can see that I was completely out of my mind during this time, and I had no idea that I was being drugged.
- I was being medicated without my knowledge, and I believe this had been going on from at least December 2022 at the conservatory itself.
- Obviously the drugging was most intense during the chamber music classes themselves where the trumpet teacher was present, but it was also going on outside them too.

## Unintended consequences of drugging an adult person without their knowledge

- I am a yoga practitioner and have done huge amounts of meditation and intense spiritual practices over the years.
- My practices have made me extremely sensitive, including physically, which is why possibly the dose of whatever they gave me the month previously had such a dramatic and traumatic effect on my system.
- Another of my favorite spiritual yoga practices is bhakti yoga devotion, where you worship God in all His forms.
- Around this time, I started to become a little obsessed with Hanuman, the monkey god from the Hindu religion.

![Hanuman RAM RAM](../../content/images/hanuman.jpg)

- I have adored Hanuman for many years because he loves and protects vulnerable women and children.
- He is the number one yogi.
- I can't remember what started it, but around this time it was as if he was everywhere around me. 
- I couldn't stop thinking about him either.
- I subscribed to an Indian TV show of 630-odd episodes about his childhood and his relationship with Ram: https://www.sonyliv.com/shows/sankatmochan-mahabali-hanuman-1700000109
- I created little videos that I found delightful and put them on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/jack.chardwood.3/videos
- I put Hanuman music on my phone and alarm clock.
- I was truly obsessed with Hanuman; and I still am but not to the extent I was during 2023 which was an intense obsession.

!!! tip "Who is Hanuman?"
    - Hanuman is a major player in the Hindu epic the Ramayana.
    - He helps save Ram, Sita, and Lakshman from the evil demon Ravana.
    - He rescues Sita from Ravana who had kidnapped her and taken her to Sri Lanka.
    - Consequently, Hanuman is known for protecting women from evil men.

    ![Lord Hanuman miracles](../../content/images/lord-hanuman-miracles.jpg)

- [My alarm](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Fohbs4oCy6qU2rnG40F3blPJ6TheJL9/view?usp=sharing) that I listened to every morning to wake me up, a devotional prayer from Hanuman to Ram.

## Silvia

- People keep saying a name so that I can hear it, Silvia.
- Maria and Porsche say it meaningfully and look at me closely at piano class.
- I hear the name everywhere, I don't know why.

!!! info "Who is Silvia?"
    - To this day I don't know who or what Silvia refers to.
    - There have been numerous suggestions online about it such as:
        - Silvia is a trans identified young girl at the conservatory.
        - Silvia is one of the trumpet teacher's daughters who is being targeted by the porn gangs so he can pay a debt back.
        - Other nonsensical stories.
        - Who knows? Perhaps just a trigger to create more stress and anxiety in my mind. 
        - Probably just the trumpet teacher's wife.
