## Swami twin

- Going through the tunnel back home after class one evening, as I'm emerging from the tunnel I see a man who looks exactly like the trumpet teacher.
- It's clearly his brother and could be a twin the likeness is so strong.
- I ran up behind him and cross the road before reaching him. He flinches.
- Later that evening on Twitter posts talk about how "my brother always steals everything from me", and I reply "rotten bugger": https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1730310006132650141
- This account came up on the Google search results and I believe it is a hacker (honey trap, gang-stalker) account.

## Heading to Lourdes

- Blue car on the A23 ... I mean REALLY?

## Picture of me in my pants on Google search



## Meeting Alex



## Piano concert

- Why does someone always have to die?

## Chat with the American

- The American has been following me since August and the account was weird.
- We DM. I'm sure it's the trumpet teacher or someone very close to him who can speak/write English.
- There are more of these DMs with fake accounts over the next 8 months.
- In this one, whoever it is tells me he's nervous because he usually sees me on the WhatsApp group and chatting is different.

## Twitter

- It was around now that the hackers started to suggest they had access to the porn filmed of me in 1989.
- They posted pictures of a young girl's body that looked like me.
- They also posted silhouettes of the same thing, with brutal porn suggestions.
