## Hiking with the English ladies

- The first Saturday in January I go out with the English ladies
- I mention the trumpet teacher. Trish and Christine go silent and don't respond to what I'm saying normally at all
- I find it weird
- I mention to Trish that the trumpet teacher is the same guy we saw in Benijembla
- Trish gets angry and changes the subject
- I'm never invited to walk again. I'm cut off completely. It's shocking to me actually and I can't figure it out

## Classes continue

- The chamber music classes continue
- Vidal is flirting with me more and more, but it is sort of garish and ignorant, and I don't believe him
- I do believe he likes me though because he looks at me in a certain way, cannot hold my eye contact, and some of the things he says and does
- It also starts to feel electric in the classroom when I'm with him 
- I'm sure I like him, but does he like me back? I'm not sure. It all seems so make believe

## Ganesha

- I print out a copy of Ganesha on an A3 piece of paper
- Ganesha removes obstacles so I took it to class in my folder
- Vidal grabbed my folder in class that day and started to look inside it as if he was annoyed about something, it was weird and quite aggressive

## Poisoning

- On Monday 30th January I go to class as normal for 8pm
- The doctor is having his class before ours
- There is no sound in the classroom and the doctor comes out and they walk out together
- Class is normal and I do feel like there is an electricity between us, a chemistry
- After class finishes, I'm surprised to find I cannot walk down the stairs easily as my calves are in excrutiating pain
- It is very strange and concerning and when I get home I look my symptoms up on Google and discover I have the systems of rhabdomylse 
- I consider going to A&E as it is very serious but decide not to 
- The pain goes on for about 5 days
- Other symptoms are I have sudden dark rings under my eyes which is very noticeable and alarming
- I also start having aching in my kidneys, particularly the right kidney
- My urine is frothy
- All these symptoms tie in with the rhabdo diagnosis
- I put it down to a hike I did at the weekend, but there was nothing extraordinary about it and I had recently done far more strenuous hikes on a regular basis. There was no other explanation at the time.

## Mental state

- I can't stop thinking about this man
- I'm extremely concerned about rhabdo and having kidney damage
- I go on a very strict diet to try to heal myself
- I contact an acupuncturist in Denia to ask for help
- She is not back until May so she can't see me for a few months
