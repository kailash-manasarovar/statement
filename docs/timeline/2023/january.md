## Hiking with the English ladies

- The first Saturday in January I go hiking with the English ladies as normal.
- I mention falling in love twice, once with a gay man on holiday and once with the trumpet teacher. 
- Everyone's interested in the gay man I met on holiday, where he lives, what he does for work, etc.
- Whenever I try to talk about the trumpet teacher, no one wants to know. Patricia and Christine, especially, go quiet and tongue-tied.
- I notice this and file it away, but I have a vague feeling that it seems as if they know what's going on at the conservatory somehow.
- One of the other ladies says something like; "you wanna be careful, he might put you in the movies", but I thought it was just a joke.
- My mind could not, at that time, possibly comprehend that a lone woman could be terrorized by everyone in a whole region of Spain, and beyond eventually, so I don't fully understand why Patricia and Christine would be so unusually reticent.
- It's so weird, however, I don't forget it.

!!! info
    - This was the day that Christine made an off-the-cuff remark about Patricia having done porn, which Patricia brushed aside in an annoyed way, and which I thought must be a joke.

- When we are alone a little later, I mention to Patricia that the trumpet teacher is the same guy we saw in Benijembla.
- Patricia gets angry and changes the subject.
- **I'm never invited to walk again.** In fact, I'm cut off completely from the English ladies walking group. It's shocking to me actually and I can't figure it out at all. I'm offended.
- I still see Christine now and then for lunch, however, as if everything's ok.

!!! warning "Thoughts added later in retrospect after finishing this report"
    - I wonder what the conversations were like between Christine and whoever she was reporting back to, Patricia probably, Hazel Smith even.
    - Were there discussions on how likely it was that I would commit suicide, or whether they would have to murder me instead?
    - As the horror continued into late 2023 and then 2024, Were they surprised that I had managed to avoid whatever the trumpet teacher had been planning for me after June 12th 2023?
    - Were they watching live spy cam porn from my apartment? Had they seen something similar a long time previously, around 2007 perhaps?
    - Who are they discussing now? Could it be someone else who had innocently joined the Javea Computer Club?

- I now believe they saw no option but to exclude me, as they were surprised about how much I had noticed already, and would not want me going along each week babbling on about the terror they were well aware was planned and set up for me by local people they knew.
- It would be embarrassing for them and probably make them feel guilty. So they stopped inviting me to come walking.

## Chamber music classes continue

- The chamber music classes continue.
- The trumpet teacher is flirting with me more and more, but his behavior is sort of garish and ignorant; phoney.
- I do believe he likes me though because he looks at me in a certain way, he cannot hold eye contact with me, and some of the things he says and does, outside of him behaving like an immature and sexist brute, make me quite sure he is attracted to me.
- It also starts to feel electric in the classroom when I'm with him, like I'm vibrating.
- I wonder if he feels it too.

!!! danger "Spiking with aphrodisiacs"
    - I had no suspicions I was being spiked with drugs at this time; something too awful to even consider being a possibility.
    - However, everything I wrote about my feelings during that time - in letters and emails and tweets, and things I said to my therapists also - talks about how I never felt anything like this in my whole life, that my whole body was vibrating in class when I was with him, and I always mentioned the debilitating after effects each week particularly on my kidney health.

## Noises upstairs after Monday chamber music classes

- Whenever a chamber music class takes place - which is not every week - after I arrive home I feel dreadful, my kidneys ache and I have to lie down.
- Then I wake up late and I am kept from going back to sleep again by loud noises from the upstairs apartment; scraping chairs, loud TV, and loud voices.
- Did people come into my apartment without my knowledge, and while I was there, every Monday night after chamber music class?

## Ganesha

- I print out a copy of Ganesha on an A4 piece of paper.
- Ganesha removes obstacles in the Hindu faith so I take it to chamber music class in my folder because there is something sinister going on that I don't understand. It is an obstacle to my peace that needs to be removed.
- The trumpet teacher grabbed my folder in class that day. He started to look inside it as if he was annoyed about something. It was weird and quite aggressive and, at that moment, it seemed to me he had information about something in my folder that he shouldn't have.

## Yoga

- I do yoga three times a week online at home.
- I started to have the distinct sensation that the trumpet teacher was in the room with me whenever I did yoga.
- It was very bizarre but there was a sense of a dark figure standing watching me, and it was him.
- I can't explain this.

!!! info
    - After I find out in August that all my devices have been hacked to a very extreme extent; key loggers, root access, full access to cameras, etc, and for a long time too, this memory is startling.

## Poisoning

!!! danger "Crime alert"
    - Drugging people without their knowledge is a crime.
    - Drugging people and causing them serious injury by doing so is a crime.

- On Monday 30th January I go to class as normal for 8pm.
- The doctor, Joan, from the DÃ©nia hospital attends his class which is scheduled before ours, 7-8pm.
- There is no sound in the classroom, no music, no talking. Eventually the doctor comes out and they walk out together.
- Class is normal but I do feel like there is an electricity between myself and the trumpet teacher, a chemistry.
- My body is vibrating.
- After class finishes, I'm surprised to find I cannot walk down the stairs as my calves are in excruciating pain at every step I take.
- It is very strange and concerning, and when I get home I look my symptoms up on Google and discover I have the systems of rhabdomyolysis. 
- I consider going to A&E as it is very serious but decide not to when I read that it can cure after a few days on its own.
- The pain goes on for about 5 days then disappears.
- I have some other unusual symptoms too: sudden dark rings under my eyes, aching in my back at the kidney area, and particularly the right kidney. My urine is frothy too.
- I have an enormous dramatic bump and discoloration on my left thumbnail, and similar but less on my right. It's ugly and very noticeable. Maria Hontanilla notices it and mentions it in piano class.
- All these symptoms tie in with the rhabdo diagnosis which requires some major trauma to the muscles and internal systems. Rhabdo is something you get when you:
    - Are in a car accident.
    - Run a marathon dehydrated.
    - Get hit by lightning.
    - Are poisoned.
- I put it down to a hike I did at the weekend, but there was nothing extraordinary about the hike, and I had recently done far more strenuous hikes in the Pyrenees. There was no other explanation at that time however.

!!! info "Tweets related to rhabdo"
    - I didn't tweet about rhabdo at the time but I did Google search it extensively.
    - I mention it in August of 2023 at the time the "conversation" with hackers really began.
    - Example: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1686848541346443270

- The doctor never comes to class again after this. He only came to two classes in total.
