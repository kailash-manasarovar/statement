## Hiking with the English ladies

- The first Saturday in January I go hiking with the English ladies as normal.
- I mention falling in love twice; once with a gay man on holiday and once with the trumpet teacher. 
- Everyone's interested in the gay man I met on holiday, where he lives, what he does for a living, etc.
- Whenever I try to talk about the trumpet teacher, no one wants to know. Patricia and Christine, especially, go silent and tongue-tied.
- I have a vague feeling that all my English friends know what's going on at the conservatory somehow, and it's not good. 
- Their reaction adds to my apprehension.
- One of the other ladies says something like; "you wanna be careful, he might put you in the movies", but whenever people said incongruous things like this, I thought it was just a joke.
- I notice everything and file it away.
- My mind could not, at that time, possibly comprehend that a female student of the conservatory could be terrorized by teachers and staff there, and ignored by the school board and police when trying to get help. 
- For this cultural ignorance, perhaps, I didn't fully understand why Patricia and Christine would be so unusually reticent.
- It's so weird, however, I don't forget it.

!!! info "Oh, Patricia's done porn"
    - This was the day that Christine made an off-the-cuff remark about Patricia being in porn.
    - "She's done porn", she said.
    - Patricia shrugged and brushed it aside in an annoyed way, and said nothing.
    - I thought must be a joke.
    - It was weird.

- When we are alone a little later, I mention to Patricia that the trumpet teacher is the same guy we saw in Benijembla at the end of November.
- Patricia gets angry and changes the subject.
- **I'm never invited to walk again.** In fact, I'm cut off completely from the English ladies walking group. It's shocking to me actually and I can't figure it out at all. 
- I'm offended and upset.
- I still see Christine now and then for lunch, however, and she behaves as if everything's fine.

!!! warning "Reporting back"
    - Having successfully removed my only (apparent) support network, the criminals will have required someone to report back on me. 
    - And that must have been Christine in her 'let's have lunch' capacity, even though she had completely stopped inviting me out to walk.
    - It's funny how everyone treated me as if I was an idiot.
    - I wonder what the conversations were like between Christine and whoever she was reporting back to, Patricia probably, Hazel Smith eventually.
    - Were there discussions on how likely it was that I would have a nervous breakdown or commit suicide, if I would be terrorized sufficiently to leave the conservatory and enter a honey-trap relationship, the likelihood of having to murder me if things worked out a different way than planned?
    - As the horror continued into late 2023 and then 2024, were they surprised that I had managed to avoid whatever the trumpet teacher, Domingo's family and the Smith's had been planning for me after June 12th 2023?
    - Who are they targeting now, I wonder? A wealthy ex-pat new to the area with no knowledge of the extent of criminal corruption that controls even the schools your children might go to? Or a beautiful foreign minor child they're keen to quickly get up on the porn networks and start earning for them?

- They must have seen no option but to exclude me, as they were surprised about how much I had noticed already, and would not want me going along each week babbling on about the terror they were well aware was planned and set up for me by local people they knew.
- It would be embarrassing for them and they had to keep it quiet from other members of the walking group, some of whom had been complaining about weird and unusual health problems.

## Chamber music classes continue

- The chamber music classes continue.
- The trumpet teacher is flirting with me more and more, but his behavior is sort of garish and ignorant; phoney.
- I do believe he likes me though because he looks at me in a certain way, he cannot hold eye contact with me, and some of the things he says and does, outside of him behaving like an immature and sexist brute, make me quite sure he is attracted to me.
- It also starts to feel electric in the classroom when I'm with him, like I'm vibrating.
- I wonder if he feels it too.

!!! danger "Spiking with aphrodisiacs"
    - I had no suspicions I was being spiked with drugs at this time; something too awful to even consider being a possibility.
    - However, everything I wrote about my feelings during that time - in letters and emails and tweets, and things I said to my therapists also - talks about how I never felt anything like this in my whole life, that my whole body was vibrating in class when I was with him, and I always mentioned the debilitating after effects each week particularly on my kidney health.

## Noises upstairs after Monday chamber music classes

- Whenever a chamber music class takes place - which is not every week - after I arrive home I feel dreadful, my kidneys ache and I have to lie down.
- Then I wake up late and I am kept from going back to sleep again by loud noises from the upstairs apartment; scraping chairs, loud TV, and loud voices.
- Did people come into my apartment without my knowledge, and while I was there, every Monday night after chamber music class?

## Ganesha

- I print out a copy of Ganesha on an A4 piece of paper.
- Ganesha removes obstacles in the Hindu faith so I take it to chamber music class in my folder because there is something sinister going on that I don't understand. It is an obstacle to my peace that needs to be removed.
- The trumpet teacher grabbed my folder in class that day. He started to look inside it as if he was annoyed about something. It was weird and quite aggressive and, at that moment, it seemed to me he had information about something in my folder that he shouldn't have.

## Yoga

- I do yoga three times a week online at home.
- I started to have the distinct sensation that the trumpet teacher was in the room with me whenever I did yoga.
- It was very bizarre but there was a sense of a dark figure standing watching me, and it was him.
- I can't explain this.

!!! info
    - After I find out in August that all my devices have been hacked to a very extreme extent; key loggers, root access, full access to cameras, etc, and for a long time too, this memory is startling.

## Poisoning

!!! danger "Crime alert"
    - Drugging people without their knowledge is a crime.
    - Drugging people and causing them serious injury by doing so is a crime.

- On Monday 30th January I go to class as normal for 8pm.
- The doctor, Joan, from the DÃ©nia hospital attends his class which is scheduled before ours, 7-8pm.
- There is no sound in the classroom, no music, no talking. Eventually the doctor comes out and they walk out together.
- Class is normal but I do feel like there is an electricity between myself and the trumpet teacher, a chemistry.
- My body is vibrating.
- After class finishes, I'm surprised to find I cannot walk down the stairs as my calves are in excruciating pain at every step I take.
- It is very strange and concerning, and when I get home I look my symptoms up on Google and discover I have the systems of rhabdomyolysis. 
- I consider going to A&E as it is very serious but decide not to when I read that it can cure after a few days on its own.
- The pain goes on for about 5 days then disappears.
- I have some other unusual symptoms too: sudden dark rings under my eyes, aching in my back at the kidney area, and particularly the right kidney. My urine is frothy too.
- I have an enormous dramatic bump and discoloration on my left thumbnail, and similar but less on my right. It's ugly and very noticeable. Maria Hontanilla notices it and mentions it in piano class.
- All these symptoms tie in with the rhabdo diagnosis which requires some major trauma to the muscles and internal systems. Rhabdo is something you get when you:
    - Are in a car accident.
    - Run a marathon dehydrated.
    - Get hit by lightning.
    - Are poisoned.
- I put it down to a hike I did at the weekend, but there was nothing extraordinary about the hike, and I had recently done far more strenuous hikes in the Pyrenees. There was no other explanation at that time however.

!!! info "Tweets related to rhabdo"
    - I didn't tweet about rhabdo at the time but I did Google search it extensively.
    - I mention it in August of 2023 at the time the "conversation" with hackers really began.
    - Example: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1686848541346443270

- The doctor never comes to class again after this. He only came to two classes in total. 
- I go to my GP on a few occasions over the next months after this incident because I am extremely concerned about my kidney health.
- I ask for a full blood work up including kidney analysis. 
- They send blood and urine to the lab to do all the tests, except when the results come back they haven't done the kidney tests.
- I ask why. The GP doesn't know.
- I try to do a test myself from the local chemist; their pamphlet says they have them available. They never have it whenever I ask for it and they never seem to know why or when it's coming in.
- One of the pharmacists tells me, "Oh, I don't think we sell the kidney tests anymore."
