## Google search

- Elon Musk makes it impossible to stalk accounts unless you are logged in.
- I had been stalking @jctot19 until that time fairly easily as even though he blocked me I didn't have to log in to see his posts
- Now that was impossible unless I used a fake account which I did a couple of time but he seemed to know about immediately
- Instead, I started to look him up on Google search with this search term "jctot19 x"
- I start to see strange pictures posted on here 
- Irene
- Ana
- Carmen
- Two cartoon men
