## Nacho caresses the 8-year old

- I continue to go into the conservatory to practice.
- One afternoon, all the teachers are there collecting something from Gloria at reception, paperwork of some sort.
- I'm waiting for a key to a room with a piano.
- All the teachers there are smirking at me.
- I feel like I'm the better person so it doesn't bother me.
- Nacho (Nacho Guerrero Nácher), the clarinet teacher, is there and he is talking to a mother who is with her daughter who must be no more than 8 years old.
- Nacho looks at me quickly, then starts to caress the child's face, stroking it suggestively, while talking to the mother.
- Everyone is embarrassed. I feel sick. Gloria looks away.
- He is doing this to show me that he, a teacher at the conservatory, can do whatever he likes to the little girls.

## Twitter

- The weird communication continues on Twitter.
- Pictures of Ana continue to come up on the trumpet teacher's timeline.
- I start to look more closely at the `@jctot19` account and I see much interaction with `@SchrodingerGata`, but more so with an account called **Carmen** with address `@sinremite`.

### Tweets

Some of my tweets from that time.

## Google search

- Elon Musk makes it impossible to stalk accounts unless you are logged in.
- I had been looking at the `@jctot19` account activity until that time fairly easily as, even though the account had blocked me, I didn't have to log in to see the posts.
- Now that was impossible unless I used a fake account, which I did a couple of times, but it was cumbersome and he seemed to know about them immediately.
- So, instead, I started to look him up on Google search with this search term:
    
    ```txt
    "jctot19 twitter" or "jctot19 x"
    ```

- In the image section, I started to see strange pictures posted on these Google search results, and sometimes in the main section too.

!!! info "These search results are extremely significant"
    - This ended up being one of the more definitive ways the hackers communicated with me and shared information.
    - The hackers were able to manipulate the results of this Google search request.
    - Significant pictures, or posts, would appear in these results and then disappear. 
    - This is where they will eventually post the picture of me in my underwear that I will take in August 2023 in France from my mobile phone.
    - It's not clear how they can manipulate search in this way, although more recently the suggestion is a hidden cache on my machine.
    - I explain how this has been happening to the cyber expert the following May, who fails to produce any kind of criminal report for me.
    - I was not taking screenshots at this time because it was unclear what was going on, and at that time I had no idea I had been hacked.

- The following are examples of things that came up in Google search during this period.

## Plate lady early in the month

- On the `@jctot19` account's Google search results, I start to see various photos of a tiny pretty lady who is a potter or a ceramics artist.

![plate lady](../../content/images/plate-lady/plate-lady-happy-1.png)

- I see her in her studio, putting plates on the wall.

![putting up the plates](../../content/images/plate-lady/plate-lady-puts-up-plates.png)

- She is short and cute. She looks Spanish and must be around 30 years old or so.
- She wears little navy blue shorts that look like Iyengar yoga pants.
- Whoever is taking the pictures is a male who is close to her. He's much taller than her and it's clear they are in a relationship of some sort.
- I never see what he looks like.

![relationship with the photographer](../../content/images/plate-lady/plate-lady-happy-2.png)

- From the look in her eyes, one photo is clearly taken just a few moments before they will be sexually intimate with each other.

![just before sex](../../content/images/plate-lady/plate-lady-love.png)

- Her look reminds me of how myself and the trumpet teacher looked at each other at the [chamber music concert in May](may.md#chamber-music-concert).
- I start to wonder if plate lady is aware she's being photographed. And if not, I wonder how he is doing it.
- I wonder if plate lady is the trumpet teacher's girlfriend.

## Plate lady later in the month

- A few weeks go by.
- The pictures of plate lady change. I see her walking in the rice paddies of Valencia with a man. It's winter.

![winter in the rice paddies](../../content/images/plate-lady/rice-paddies.png)

- The man's shape and build is exactly that of the trumpet teacher, although you cannot see his face.
- Whoever is taking these pictures is way back from the couple; 50-100 metres, following.
- The man is telling plate lady something important as they walk. The mood is so sombre, I wonder if he is breaking up with her.

![he is telling her something](../../content/images/plate-lady/plate-lady-finds-out.PNG)

- Whatever he tells her has shocked her to her core. 
- It's obvious that the man who has the exact silhouette of the trumpet teacher has told plate lady they are being photographed at that moment. 
- Plate lady's horrified expression is exaggerated in the photo as she looks directly at the cameraman.

![shock and horror](../../content/images/plate-lady/shock.png)

!!! critical
    - At the time, I have no idea what any of this is about, what it means, or who she is.
    - I believe the pics to be current, present day activity; perhaps she is a girlfriend he has dumped, for me maybe?
    - Over a year later, hackers give me her name; Irene.
    - I write about the discovery [in the August 2024 report](../2024/august.md#irene-the-plate-lady).
    - I look her up and find her online. The very same woman. Except, she is in her 50s.
    - The pictures are from 30 years ago.
    - This fact provokes more questions than it answers.
    - The trumpet teacher's gang had extraordinarily advanced surveillance technology even in the 80s and 90s. This casts a light on a million different other things we might be interested in.
    - And who would be so keen to grass up the trumpet teacher's gang in this way? Even giving a name?
    - Could it be the British gangs he had betrayed so boldly?

## Carmen

- Results of this search always included a picture of a cartoon woman, Carmen. And they still do, even today.
- This is the `@sinremite` account I mentioned that has a lot of interaction with the `@jctot19` account.

![Carmen in today's results](../../content/images/google-searches/Screenshot%202024-11-17%20at%2007.15.36.png)

- Most of the images in the screenshot above are new, I haven't seen them previously, apart from the Carmen image which has been appearing on and off since July 2023, and the photo of Rocio Vidal which has been appearing probably since around October 2023 and we will talk about that [later](october.md#rocio-vidal) as it is significant.
- Curiously, I thought Carmen was plate lady but that wasn't the case. Carmen, as I'm informed later, represents Carmen Cano, Domingo's sister, a major player in the deceit and harassment.

## Other smaller examples

### The guy at the Alhambra

- The plate lady pictures stop completely and I start seeing a similar "set" of repeated pictures with a specific character.
- This time, it's a man sitting at a bench with the Alhambra behind him in Granada. 
- The picture is viewable for a few weeks.
- I will see this man at the beach in September.

![man at the alhambra](../../content/images/man-at-the-alhambra.png)

### Ana

- Interspersed with this are more references to Ana, and more pictures of her modelling.

![ana](../../content/images/fake-accounts/GZ69WCMXQAEQdzB.png)

- I saw a whole range of these pictures of Ana which are undoubtedly easily to come across if you can be bothered to look. You could ask her too, of course.

### Mortadelo y Filemón

- Pictures of two cartoon men, Mortadelo y Filemón, I understood to reference the trumpet teacher and Domingo as crashing fools.
- It turns out that around this time the cartoonist died so that was in keeping with the times and, perhaps, was not related intentionally.

![mortadella and filemon](../../content/images/mortadella-and-f.jpg)

### Girl with a cross on her back

- I see a picture of a woman wearing a black dress with a cross strap at the back.
- She has her back to the photographer and appears to be in a studio.
- I will see this woman again at the checkout at the Carrefour store in Dénia in October 2024.
- The reference is to the tattoo I have on my back, and that I am a target.

![Woman with a cross on her back](../../content/images/woman-with-a-cross-on-her-back.png)

## Thailand

- Early in the month I go to Thailand for a holiday.
- I do not take my laptop so I am not connected to my Twitter account.
- The pictures referenced above continue to appear in the search results of `@jctot19 twitter`.
- At some point, the pictures of the plate lady stop.
- There are now references to Thailand and the far east, pictures of tall apartment buildings in Hong Kong, for example.
- I'm certain he (I assume the trumpet teacher) is somehow manipulating Google search to show me things and I don't know how.
- I connect to hotel networks usually and I have a lot of issues logging into my banking apps. I lose access to my Openbank app  and can't log in until I get back home.
- Then, I see a tweet which appears to have a message for me directly: **don't leave me murph**. It blows my mind.
- This is actually a misquote from what was actually said in the film.

![Don't leave me murph](../../content/images/twitter-hacking/dont%20leave%20me%20murph.png)

!!! info
    - Later in this saga, I'm informed that twitter hacking can take place in a number of ways, one of which is a parasitical manner whereby hackers have delegated access to larger accounts and can therefore post on them.
    - Also, I'm told that Mac spoofing can overwrite anything a targeted machine sees.
    - However, this tweet is definitively public and available so I'm guessing delegated access and/or involvement of the account owner.

- Curiously, and something I've only just realized, is that I had no sexual feelings at all while I was in Thailand.
- I met a woman on holiday with her family in Thailand, Hala, and I told her everything that had happened.

### A nightmare, and God is there too

- One night, during the detox, I have a terrifying dream.
- I dream that Domingo and his family will have me arrested by the police, for some lie they invent, and I end up in jail for 7 years.
- I wake up, horrified. The wall beside my bed starts to glow. It is a window into another dimension, another world. I see trees, a forest.
- Something's coming.
- It's light like I've never seen before and it has nearly reached my bedroom.
- I'm so scared I get out of bed and run to an area of the room which is out of the 'line of sight', as it were, of the Light which is pounding in to my bedroom at the wall beside my bed.
- I'm hyperventilating, crouched down, terrified.
- The dream ends as the light gently fades.
- I feel like a biblical character when God comes with a message; someone who lies down on the floor in fear.
- It's all just too terrifying to comprehend.
- The next morning, I'm still reeling from this dream. I'm certain I'm going to be arrested and end up in jail for 7 years.
- I tell Hala and her ex-husband and the centre manager Patrick about my nightmare, but not about the light cos that's a bit embarrassing.
- Looking back, I can see I was psychologically unbalanced somehow at this time, and I wonder now if I was still ingesting some sort of psychoactive substance via my toiletries, or perhaps through some of my health supplements like my antifungal product maybe.
- I wonder now, in 2025, if I was being micro-dosed with mushrooms which were coupled with NLP/hypnosis techniques online for specific mind-controlling effects.
- I wonder too if this rather backfired on the criminal gangs as it seemed to be cracking open my mind in exceptionally good ways. I can't believe this was intentional.

## Durian for Gloria

- On my way back home to Spain, I buy a present for Concha and a present for Gloria.
- I'm so disgusted with Gloria's behavior, I buy her some durian which is quite delicious but famously doesn't smell very nice.
- I include a [letter to Concha in Spanish](../../content/documents/letters/Letter%20to%20Concha-ES.pdf) in Concha's present and I WhatsApp message her later to make sure she has received it.

!!! info "Letter to Concha in English"
    - My Spanish is not very good so I always have to have a starting point of English. 
    - Here is my first [letter to Concha in English](../../content/documents/letters/Letter%20to%20Concha.pdf).

- This letter was an attempt to apologize to Concha if I had upset her by mentioning Domingo's students bullying her on Twitter. I was worried about that, even though I never mentioned any names at any time.
- It's clear from my letter that, at this stage, I have absolutely no idea what's really going on other than that I have been bullied by teachers and staff at the conservatory. I assume it was because I wrote the message expressing my feelings to the trumpet teacher in Spanish on Twitter and some angry tweets about Domingo when he didn't respond.
- Concha was my friend so I felt I could reach out to her.
- She responded by asking me if I had been abused by the trumpet teacher and, if I had, I was to report it immediately and she would help me.

![Emailing with Concha](../../content/images/Email%20proofs%20of%20both%20letters%20to%20Concha.png)

- Unfortunately, although indeed I had been abused by him, I had no idea how at that time.
- I wrote a longer letter explaining everything that had happened and what I understood at that time.

## Second letter to Concha

- Spanish version of the [second letter to Concha](../../content/documents/letters/My%20experience%20-%20ES.pdf).
- English version of the [second letter to Concha](../../content/documents/letters/My%20experience%20-%20EN.pdf).

!!! danger "Disinterested Dénia police"
    - When I go to the [police in February 2024](../2024/february.md#policia-nacional) after a threat of violence on Twitter, I take numerous documents written in Spanish for them to look at, including my complaints to the school board, to explain what has been happening to me. 
    - They only look at the letters I have written to Concha and tell me there's no crime and I should go away. 
    - They tell me I should take a civil case against the conservatory.
    - They clearly wanted nothing to do with me.

- After reading this document, Concha makes no response to me at all.
- Her silence speaks a thousand words.
- I WhatsApp Concha briefly when I'm being [cyber-stacked and attacked online at the end of August in France](august.md#the-hackers-reveal-themselves), and I tell her that they have been hacking me and I'm scared. I ask her if she thinks these people are dangerous? She says she doesn't think so.

## Driving to Lourdes

- I'm home briefly after returning from Thailand, the constant online communication (harassment) continues. I feel sexually aroused at home again.
- I set off for Lourdes and to spend the summer in France.
- I'm driving to Zaragoza where I will stay one night.
- Just ouside of Oliva, a woman calls me, it's a missed call. I look her up on WhatsApp. She looks like the trumpet teacher. I'm guessing its his mum. The message on her WhatsApp profile is significant too.

![Trumpet teacher's mum](../../content/images/image_123650291.png)

## The traffic police stop me

- Just outside Teruel, I am stopped by the Guardia Civil traffic police.
- They inform me my driving license is invalid as it is a British one and I should have changed it.
- I tell them I thought I had six months from March 2023 when the law changed and was going to do it in September when I returned to Spain.
- Apparently it was three months, or I had made some mistake or other, anyway the conversation was very nice, we spoke amiably and politely, and the officer told me he was going to fine me 100 euros instead of the 500 I could have been fined.
- I was very apologetic and assured him I would deal with it immediately I was back from France. I had been initially really scared they would stop me from driving in Spain.
- We were talking about stuff, and I forgot a word I needed, the word for management service (gestor), as I was explaining I would get them to deal with it immediately, but I couldn't remember the word, and I was scratching my head ... and he says ...
- "Ladrones de Dénia", which means bad people of Dénia.
- It was an extraordinarily weird thing to say, and I took it to mean I had been grassed up by Domingo and his associates as I was driving to France because the identification document the conservatory had was my British driving license, and because of the good relationship I was having with this man, he informed me, somehow.
- What I didn't realize yet was that they could tell the police the exact moment I would be in a particular area of the carriageway, on the A23 outside Teruel, because they were tracking my movements and had been for some time probably. 
- This stop, and the missed call previously, is surely evidence that my movements were being tracked.

## Lourdes

- I arrive in Lourdes.
- When I meet my friend, I'm sorry to tell her that my negative suspicions about what had been going on were correct and that I had been bullied and targeted by Domingo and his associates and that the trumpet teacher was involved also.
- I was still in love, however. And still out of my mind.

## Tweets

These are a selection of tweets from this period which relate to everything that has been happening. Most of them have been translated, a lot, so I assume the Spanish are reading them.

Many of these tweets are confirmation of what has been going on.
