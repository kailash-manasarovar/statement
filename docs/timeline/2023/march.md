## Chamber music classes continued

- One day in March, the trumpet teacher canceled a class by sending a WhatsApp message during the day at some point. I cried that he was not coming. It was *extraordinarily* weird. I don't cry as a rule. It takes an awful lot to make me cry. I felt that I must really be in love with this guy.
- I found myself always harboring the expectation that he would be coming home with me after class, and I bought extra food for that purpose. There was no reason at all to think that might happen and, even if it were, that's something I'm not sure I would have been at all OK with anyway.
- All this was just thoughts only. Nothing real or tangible.

!!! info "Looking back"
    - I believe now that the online romantic honey-trap grooming had really ramped up at this stage, and I was being fed NLP/hypnosis type suggestions on Twitter, and possibly elsewhere, which were reinforcing these drugged feelings of lightheadedness that I had in class.
    - The trick was making me believe that I was in love and that it was reciprocal.
    - I believe that these NLP grooming techniques are able to suggest a reciprocity that doesn't necessarily exist.

- Whenever the trumpet teacher turned up for class, not often, I felt the same lightheadedness in class.
- Moreover, whenever I returned home from class I felt like I had run a marathon, my kidneys ached, and I had to lie down
- I couldn't understand this at all.
- It was never as intense as on Mondays during and after class but the lightheadedness, which I put down to being in love, continued every day of the week, even on the days when I never left the house.
- I was always extremely anxious about going to class on a Monday and had to take my PTSD remedy beforehand to get calm enough to go. I believe this was because at some level I knew what was going on and it frightened me.

## Leaving class

- Whenever I left the chamber music class to go home on a Monday night, Gloria would be there at reception.
- She would grin and wink at me in a conspiratorial manner.

## Piano classes

- I'm reminded of the song Misty, I used to play it at university.
- It's from the film about a stalker, Play Misty for Me.
- I'm playing it one day at class with Maria who was busy with something else, as usual.
- She reads the marks out for me for the term, telling me the marks the trumpet teacher has given me.
- I tell her I feel like I'm on fire. She tells me I'm in love with him.
- She calls him Charlot, which is what the Spanish call Charlie Chaplin.

## Choir rehearsal at the boat club

- At the end of term we have a choir rehearsal at the boat club in Denia.
- Paqui's husband is there, scowling and glaring at everyone.
- He looks extremely angry.
- It's weird.

!!! tip
    - I now believe Paqui brought him in to see me.

## Work stress

- Work is becoming extremely stressful and I'm not able to handle the things that are going on there.
- I quit my job but I have another one lined up to go to immediately.
