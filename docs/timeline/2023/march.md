## Classes continued

- Whenever he turned up for class, not often, I felt the same light-headedness
- Moreover, whenever I returned home from class I felt like I had run a marathon, my kidneys ached, and I had to lie down
- I couldn't understand this at all
- It was never as intense than at class but the light-headedness, which I put down to being in love, continued every day of the week, even the days when I never left the house

## Leaving class

- Whenever I left the chamber music class, Gloria would be there at reception 
- She would grin and wink at me
