# October 2023

- Gang and cyber-stalking continues apace.
- It's relentless and I seem to be experiencing some persecutory evil every minute of the day.
- As a fake X account said to me in September, as if the person running it knew what was going on, "It sounds like they want you trapped and to watch you suffer."

![Trapped and suffering](../../content/images/trapped-and-suffering.png)

## Stalked online around the clock

- It is obvious to me that stalkers are reading my tweets around the clock, and not just a few.
- Because I could see how many people were translating my tweets, I knew what time they had to be up.
- It was very surprising to see people reading my tweets at all hours of the night whenever I tweeted.
- I wondered who might be up to:
    - Admin-read an interesting tweet that needed to be shared with the community of stalkers.
    - Share the tweet on WhatsApp or wherever.
    - See an alert about a new tweet on the WhatsApp group or wherever they were sharing my information.
    - Read it as a participant.
- Were they shift workers working at night, or were they truly around the world. I suspect the latter.

## The trumpet teacher drives past me in his car

- I'm walking back from the Indian restaurant with my takeaway.
- A car is driving slowly alongside me as I walk, kerb crawling.
- It is a bright primary-blue Fiat Doblo-type vehicle, the same car that Christine BJ has in white.

![The blue car](../../content/images/the-blue-car.png)

- As I turn into the road of my apartment block, the car follows slowly along beside me.
- As I'm opening the gate, the car drives slowly past. 
- I look and I see the trumpet teacher is driving the car.
- He looks at me.
- I have no idea why he has done this.
- This blue Fiat Doblo often features in the stalking from now on.
- I saw [Ana in it](november.md#ana-in-the-blue-van) a month later in a most bizarre scenario.
- I guess the trumpet teacher was showing me the car so I'd recognize it again when I saw it.
- Also, online hacker-chatter was suggesting that the Cano Lopez family had paid for his work torturing me with this car. 
- It was certainly a better one than the Peugeot I'd seen him driving before on [various occasions](june.md#the-trumpet-teacher-and-the-doctor-joan-drive-past-me). 
- Although probably none of these cars are his own car; I rather expect that one to be fast, expensive, and new.

!!! info "They are monitoring and surveilling me continuously"
    - Hopefully it's now extremely clear that the evil people in Dénia know exactly where I am at any time.
    - This could only be possible by tracking my mobile minute-by-minute.
    - Every time I leave my house, for whatever purpose, they're poised to begin some ridiculous choreographed torment.
    - They must put enormous effort and resources into this. 
    - I wonder what benefit they could be getting from their behavior. 
    - Do they have a choice in whether they take part?
    - It's clear the good people of Dénia have a really, really nasty festering problem.

## Gang stalking by conservatory civil servants

### Choir

- Bullying at choir continues.
- Salva gives us *suggestive* scores with titles and content related to the gang stalking.
- He's unpleasant and rude. 
- He makes fun of my name and the way I speak.
- Things I have said on Twitter have been shared with the students and the choir teacher Salva. 
- For example, this rather innocuous tweet:

[![Woman seeks drivers license](../../content/tweets/woman-seeks-drivers.png)](https://x.com/JackChardwood/status/1708197553483763859)

- You'd really have to know the whole backstory to understand that this message is suggesting that the trumpet teacher come with me to Ireland because I need to hire a car and don't have a driving license.
- I am in love with him after all, and we are having a relationship online.
- Salva mentions "going away for the weekend with your boyfriend" nearly every class after that.
- The class after I posted this tweet, a student comes up to me as I enter the choir classroom, and asks me grinning, "Are you going away for the weekend?"
- The girl (Elsa Martí García) is a piano student of Domingo. I suspect she's following his instructions.
- Her picture was posted on a fake account I received during continued cyber-stalking in 2024.

![Choir student](../../content/images/fake-accounts/choir-student.png)

- Note the dog collar.
- This photo was sent the same time I was being bombarded with multiple fake accounts with pictures of women who were clearly being sexual abused in some way, or that was the inference one was supposed to make; including women [going from doing innocent photo shoots, to doing porn](../2024/august.md#photos-of-abused-women-and-girls) and women [groomed from innocently sending nudes](../2024/september.md#another-upsetting-targeted-woman) into what looked to me like a sedated attack in a car with multiple people around.
- I was concerned enough to send the pic of Elsa to the Policia's trafficking email (which is supposed to be anonymous) in October 2024.
- I got a reply from Dénia Police which, at the time of writing, I have not responded to given their [total lack of interest when I visited them](../2024/february.md#policia-nacional) and my subsequent certainty that I cannot trust them to help any of us.

### Chamber music

- In chamber music classes, the music is extremely suggestive of what's been going on and I am bravely playing my hand.
- Katia remains angry with me, meaningfully.
- I get a [warning about her](#katia-in-the-act) from a fake account online.

### Piano 

- Piano classes are good and Paqui does a good job of pretending she's neutral.
- I like her teaching style. It's a breath of fresh air after Maria.

### Cannabis bar right outside the conservatory

- Sometimes when we are sitting in choir class, the room fills with the smell of cannabis.
- It's coming from the shop that's just opened right outside the conservatory where 100s of kids and their parents visit every day.
- I find it strange that the town would allow this.
- Salva often closes the windows because of the strong smell.

## October 7th 2023

- I'm on Twitter all morning seeing posts from Israel.
- It's like I'm there.
- Everything changes at that moment.
- I realize that all the requests for money for Palestinian children I had seen on X over the last years were a scam. I'm relieved I never fell for that one.

## Strawberries

- Just over a week later, I wake up long before dawn to write a tweet thread about strawberries: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1713726935371551010.
- It blows the minds of everyone watching, everyone who knows everything about me and my life and how I have been terrorized by teachers and staff at the conservatory and how I was sexually groomed, drugged in class, and possibly assaulted at home while sedated by one (or more) of them.
- When walking to the conservatory, as I pass [this spot](https://www.google.com/maps/@38.8442052,0.1081194,3a,75y,36.63h,77.57t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sB4ssIdTdFG6H4f6v4cNyeg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D12.43052595660501%26panoid%3DB4ssIdTdFG6H4f6v4cNyeg%26yaw%3D36.626678552174724!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTExMy4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) on the Carrer de Manuel Sanchis Guarner, there's a strawberry on the ground.
- Incidentally, this is where I saw the fat bloke that had been behaving extremely strangely when [me and my Tibetan monk friend](../2023/september.md#the-tibetan-monk-visits) were at the beach. 
- Check out the analytics to see how many people translated this tweet.

![Strawberry post analytics](../../content/tweets/strawberry-post-analytics.png)

## Katia in the act

- It seems like the Google search results, and fake accounts, are sometimes on my side.
- I receive activity from the following account which was posted right before chamber music class. 

![katia in the act](../../content/images/fake-accounts/Screenshot 2024-03-08 at 08.49.19.png)

- I understood it to mean that Katia, one of the singers in chamber music, was embroiled in the fiasco somehow.
- She was. She started to become extremely angry with me for no reason, and give me a hard time generally.
- The other student obviously knew what was going on too.

## Rocio Vidal

- In the Google search results of `@jctot19 x` I now see a picture of Rocio Vidal. It is still there, even today.

![Rocio Vidal in Google search](../../content/images/Rocio-Vidal-on-Google-search.png)

!![Rocio Vidal in Google search](../../content/images/google-searches/rocio-vidal.png)

- Rocio Vidal is a famous YouTuber in Spain.
- I've been reliably informed that she was hacked.
- At some point, on fake accounts, I saw pictures of her sitting on a bed, looking at someone who is filming her and she is about to take off her clothes.
- I believe the picture posted here is when she "finds out" that she was filmed secretly, or that she agreed to be filmed, and those recordings were going to be used in some sort of blackmail. She looks upset. I could be wrong.
- The `@jctot19` account has interacted a lot with Rocio Vidal's account `@SchrodingerGata` and I saw a lot of this interaction when I was able to see it prior to Elon locking down in July. 

## Telecommunications shop

- I decide to try and get my old mobile phone fixed so I can use it instead of the one they obviously have access to.
- I go to the telecommunications expert at Mobile Express C/ de Diana, 24, 03700 Alicante Spain which is run by Chinese people.
- As I approach the shop, a guy I have seen at the conservatory a lot comes out of the shop.
- I don't know who he is but he's always around, at the conservatory and in the street. 
- I assume he is the one who has been hacking me and I start to wonder if he works as a technician at the conservatory.
- Inside the shop, the Chinese guy clearly recognizes me as he can hardly stop smiling at me.

!!! tip "This may be nothing but..."
    - As I was searching for the address of the shop, I looked up experts, and this [name came up](https://www.einforma.com/informacion-empresa/lopez-moreno-juan-david).

## Baby Jo

- I'm followed by a crypto meme coin account on Twitter: https://x.com/BabyJoeERC.
- Elaine's son is called Joe and I taught him piano when he was 12 or 13. We had a great time too.
- On Facebook, there's a lovely picture of Joe as a baby with his dummy in: https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10200343206052070&set=ecnf.1512218809.
- I believe the account and meme coin was created to terrorize me, but they might have tried to make it into something.

## My car is damaged on the Montgo

- I go walking on the Montgo, the mountain that overlooks the town, on Saturday 14th October.
- Usually I go to the top, but something told me to come back early which I did. I'm unusually concerned about my car.
- As I'm coming back, I bump into a good-looking man who has three large hunting dogs with him. I'm about 5 minutes away from my car at that point.
- As I get into my car, I notice the people at the gun club looking at me in a strange way.
- I do my shopping and go home.
- The following Saturday I go to use my car again and I notice a scratch all along its left side, clearly done purposefully.
- The only time that could have happened was the Saturday before.
- I'm furious.

## The gypsy glaring at me

- I'm walking one Saturday along the Las Rotas beaches.
- As I approach a parked car, I notice a man in the driving seat staring at me, glaring.
- He looks ridiculous and I smile at him. He flinches.
- I recognize him from somewhere.

## First letter to the Generalitat

- Letters to the Generalitat Valenciana have been appearing on Google search `@jctot19 x` and this puts an idea in my head.
- I would rather leave the police out of things unless it got extremely serious.
- I decide to write a letter of complaint to the Generalitat.
- I look up all the important people I can find and send it to them via email. 

    - [Letter in Spanish](../../content/documents/letters/3.%20Letter%20to%20Generalitat%20of%2022%20October%2023%20-%20ES.pdf).
    - [Letter in English](../../content/documents/letters/3.%20Letter%20to%20Generalitat%20of%2022%20October%2023%20-%20EN.pdf).
    - [Proof of sending](../../content/documents/letters/3.%20Proof%20of%20first%20emailed%20letter%20to%20Generalitat%20Octo%2023.png).
    - [List of recipients](../../content/documents/emails/list-of-recipients.png).

- I receive no reply at all, ever, not even a notification that my letter was received.
- In fact, I write again, a few times, to the GV and I never receive any reply from them.
- Given the seriousness of what I'm saying, it's more than weird that no-one replied to me.
- On the `jctot19 x` Google search results, a picture is displayed with a trampoline at the bottom of apartment blocks which I take to mean that Domingo is very upset.

## Hazel outside the conservatory

- I was talking about how it is often not a good idea to disclose child sexual abuse to people who aren't ready to hear it because they might attack you: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1714432159425925547.
- You may remember the reference from [earlier in 2007](../early-years/2007.md#hazel-smith).
- I was leaving the conservatory not long after that, and she was outside with a man.
- It's interesting because I never once mentioned her name on Twitter or any details that anyone except her would recognize.
- So I was certain then that she was involved in the current gang stalking. I wonder if she has been involved in the ongoing spiking/poisoning, or even the 2014 threat of poisoning from Domingo. It's certainly worth considering.
- Is it possible that the most evil people in a small town could have been introduced to something so abhorrent, but yet utterly addictive, which gave them utmost power over everyone? Is that the underlying nature of this story? I hope not, but I would not be surprised if it was.

## The petty tyrant

## Giving my trauma-therapy card to Domingo at the fruit and veg stall

- TODO:

## Porn intensifies

- The amount and nature of the porn that I'm seeing on my timeline intensifies. 
- There is a lot of artistic porn which is kind of interesting and a lot of cartoon, film, photographic, fake accounts, and textual porn.
- It's full on. A lot of it suggests violence, there's gay porn, all sorts. It's just insane.
- I now believe that, along with water is in the water at my home, the sexual grooming by hackers is intensifying and the porn I'm seeing is part of that.

## Halloween

- Alex, John, Paul, and I agree to go out for Halloween, a kind of remake of our evening all those years ago.
- The whole town knows I'm coming out but I was never clear about that on Twitter.
- I'm stopped for photos as I walk to the bar where we're going to meet.
- Prior to arriving, John has appeared a little fearful and wanted to go and find the tail I had lost from my cow costume. He said, "why don't you come with me Katie". What was he afraid of?
- The others lead the way and we end up in the Irish bar on the Calle La Mar.
- Once inside, we "bump into" this very dodgy French bloke who says he studies guitar at the conservatory and wants to know things about me. 
- I turn to Alex and say; "Sometimes it takes an outsider".
- A young man with him dressed as the joker is quite menacing towards me.
- I sing a song, a cockney song, You Made Me Love You, which blows their minds a little.
- Alessandra tells me later, a few times, that the French man had wanted to know about Halloween in 2007 and whether I had a ukelele and had sung Back to Black.

## Tweets

These are a selection of tweets from this period which relate to everything that has been happening. Most of them have been translated, a lot, so I assume the Spanish are reading them. Many of these tweets are confirmation of what has been going on.

!!! important
    - I'm realizing everyone is reading my tweets. I don't know how as I don't get all that much activity on them but everyone seems to know everything I've said.
    - A lot of my tweets have the intention of flushing the audience out, to see how far my reach goes.
    - I find out literally everyone in the town knows everything about me, and every tiny thing I've said online, and likely a lot of lies too because they all hate me.
