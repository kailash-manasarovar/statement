## Trumpet teacher drives past me in his car

- I'm walking back from the Indian restaurant with my takeaway.
- A car is driving slowly along beside me as I walk, kerb crawling. It is a bright primary-blue Fiat Doblo-type vehicle, the same car that Christine BJ has.
- As I reach the crossroads at my apartment block, the car turns into it behind me. 
- I look and the trumpet teacher is driving the car.
- I have no idea why he does this.
- This blue car often features in the stalking from this moment. I guess he was showing me the car so I'd recognize it again when I saw it.

!!! info
    - Hopefully it's now extremely clear that the people in Denia are able to know where I am at any time.
    - This could only be possible by tracking me via access to my mobile.
    - It's like they're constantly poised to begin something. They must put enormous effort into this. I wonder what benefit they could be getting from their behavior.

## Gang stalking

- Bullying at choir continues with Salva giving us *suggestive* scores related to the gang stalking.
- Things I have said on Twitter have been shared with the students and the choir teacher Salva. 
- For example, this rather innocuous tweet: https://x.com/JackChardwood/status/1708197553483763859 is suggesting that the trumpet teacher come with me to Ireland because I need to hire a car and don't have a driving license.
- A girl in the class comes up to me as I enter the choir classroom, and asks me, "Are you going away for the weekend?"
- This girl (I unfortunately can't remember her name) is a piano student of Domingo. Her picture was also posted on a fake account I received during continued cyber-stalking in 2024.

- This photo was sent the same time I was receiving tons of fake accounts with women who were clearly being sexual abused in some way, or that was the inference one was supposed to make, including women groomed from innocently sending nudes, or doing innocent photo shoots, to actually doing porn.
- I was concerned enough to send this pic to the Policia Nacional trafficking email (which is supposed to be anonymous) in October 2024.
- I got a reply from Denia Police which, at the time of writing, I have not responded to given their total lack of interest when I visited them and my suspicion that I cannot trust them.
- In chamber music classes, the music is extremely suggestive of what's been going on and I am bravely playing my hand.
- Piano classes are good and Paqui does a good job of pretending she's on my side.

## Strawberries

- One morning I wake up long before dawn to write a tweet thread about strawberries: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1713726935371551010.
- It blows everyone's mind, I'm sure.
- When walking to the conservatory, as I pass [this spot](https://www.google.com/maps/@38.8442052,0.1081194,3a,75y,36.63h,77.57t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sB4ssIdTdFG6H4f6v4cNyeg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D12.43052595660501%26panoid%3DB4ssIdTdFG6H4f6v4cNyeg%26yaw%3D36.626678552174724!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTExMy4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) on the Carrer de Manuel Sanchis Guarner, there's a strawberry on the ground.
- Incidentally, this is where I saw the fat bloke that had been behaving extremely strangely when me and my friend were at the beach. He had come very close to us (on a pretty empty part of the beach) and been using his phone frantically. Another man, sitting on a chair close to the water, had kept shouting at him to move away.
- Check out the analytics.

## Katia in the act

- It seems like the Google search results, and fake accounts, are sometimes on my side.
- I receive activity from the following account which was posted right before chamber music class. 

![katia in the act](../../content/images/fake-accounts/Screenshot 2024-03-08 at 08.49.19.png)

- I understood it to mean that Katia, one of the singers in chamber music, was embroiled in the fiasco somehow.
- She was. She started to become extremely angry with me for no reason, and give me a hard time generally.
- The other student obviously knew what was going on too.

## Rocio Vidal

- In the Google search results of `jctot19 x` I now see a picture of Rocio Vidal. It is still there, even today.

![Rocio Vidal in Google search](../../content/images/Rocio-Vidal-on-Google-search.png){width=65%}

!![Rocio Vidal in Google search](../../content/images/google-searches/rocio-vidal.png)

- Rocio Vidal is a famous YouTuber in Spain.
- I've been reliably informed that she was hacked.
- At some point, on fake accounts, I saw pictures of her sitting on a bed about to take off her clothes.
- I believe the picture posted here is when she "finds out" that she was filmed secretly, or that she agreed to be filmed and those recordings were going to be used in some sort of blackmail. She looks upset. I could be wrong.
- The `@jctot19` account has interacted a lot with Rocio Vidal's account `@SchrodingerGata` and I saw a lot of this interaction when I was able to see it prior to Elon locking down in July. 

## Telecommunications shop

- I decide to try and get my old mobile phone fixed so I can use it instead of the one they obviously have access to.
- I go to the telecommunications expert at Mobile Express C/ de Diana, 24, 03700 Alicante Spain which is run by Chinese people.
- As I approach the shop, a guy I have seen at the conservatory a lot comes out of the shop.
- I don't know who he is but he's always around, at the conservatory and in the street. 
- I assume he is the one who has been hacking me and I start to wonder if he works as a technician at the conservatory.
- Inside the shop, the Chinese guy clearly recognizes me as he can hardly stop smiling at me.

!!! tip "This may be nothing but..."
    - As I was searching for the address of the shop, I looked up experts, and this [name came up](https://www.einforma.com/informacion-empresa/lopez-moreno-juan-david).

## My car is damaged on the Montgo

- I go walking on the Montgo, the mountain that overlooks the town, one Saturday, on the 14th October.
- Usually I go to the top, but something told me to come back early which I did. I'm unusually concerned about my car.
- As I'm coming back, I bump into a good-looking man who has three large hunting dogs with him. I'm about 5 minutes away from my car at that point.
- As I get into my car, I notice the people at the gun club looking at me in a strange way.
- I do my shopping and go home.
- The following Saturday I go to use my car again and I notice a scratch all along its left side, clearly done purposefully.
- The only time that could have happened was the Saturday before.
- I'm furious.

## First letter to the Generalitat

- Letters to the Generalitat Valenciana have been appearing on Google search `@jctot19 x`.
- I would rather leave the police out of things unless it got extremely serious.
- I decide to write a letter of complaint to the Generalitat.
- I look up all the important people I can find and send it to them via email. 

    - [Letter in Spanish](../../content/documents/letters/3.%20Letter%20to%20Generalitat%20of%2022%20October%2023%20-%20ES.pdf)
    - [Letter in English](../../content/documents/letters/3.%20Letter%20to%20Generalitat%20of%2022%20October%2023%20-%20EN.pdf)
    - [Proof of sending](../../content/documents/letters/3.%20Proof%20of%20first%20emailed%20letter%20to%20Generalitat%20Octo%2023.png)

- I receive no reply at all. 
- In fact, I write again, a few times, to the GV and I never receive a reply.
- Given the seriousness of what I'm saying, it's more than weird that no-one replied to me.
- Eventually they will tell me they didn't have my address and they sent something by post in December (! December) that got sent back to them. But I communicated with them via email so that is pure male-bovine excretions.

## Porn intensifies

- The amount and nature of the porn that I'm seeing on my timeline intensifies. 
- There is a lot of artistic porn which is kind of interesting and a lot of cartoon, film, photographic, fake accounts, and textual porn.
- It's full on.
- I now believe that, along with water is in the water at my home, the sexual grooming by hackers is intensifying.

## Tweets

These are a selection of tweets from this period which relate to everything that has been happening. Most of them have been translated, a lot, so I assume the Spanish are reading them.

Many of these tweets are confirmation of what has been going on.
