## Conservatory

- Classes continue.
- Choir class is full of threats towards me via suggestive scores, Nacho popping his nose in all the time and looking at me, discussions about trumpets, mentions of Vidal and how I'm thinking about him, Domingo's students asking me ridiculous things, the choir teacher being offensive towards me in Valenciano which I don't understand, comments from the children which seem weird, for example about my name, and other stuff.
- The choir teacher makes fun of my name somehow, I don't understand the joke. This goes on continually and even concerns some of the kids.
- The French horn player, an adult woman who sits beside me, is involved. She waits at the stairs to see my reaction to Nacho as he passes by me one evening after class. When I grimace, she is satisfied and leaves.
- I'm anxious, a lot, in choir class.
- Piano is good. I enjoy playing. Paqui seems fierce but fair. I have no idea how much she hates me and/or what she is planning with all the teachers.

!!! note
    - On balance, hate is probably not the main motivator for the relentless gang stalking and bullying by teachers at the conservatory at this stage.
    - In fact, my studies at the conservatory were supposed to end definitively on June 12th, but didn't.
    - The fact that teachers and staff had to continue with their ridiculous charade must have been very annoying and upsetting for them.
    - So, instead of doing the right thing, and letting it all go, and leaving me in peace to play the piano, they decided their best move was to make things worse for me so that I would definitely leave.

- Harmony class is OK. I struggle to understand the content, however, and I no longer sit next to Samuel who helped me in the previous year. I sit on my own and no-one speaks to me.
- Chamber music is stressful. The women are play acting they hate me and it's all a bit of a farce.
- Katia brings in a duet from the opera Norma about two women in love with the same man, one has two children with him. The trumpet teacher, allegedly, has two daughters and the reference is that Norma and Adalgisa are Ana and I and we are both in love with the same man.
- I have brought in something equally suggestive. 
- Random students make comments related to my Twitter activity in the halls.
- It's all very stressful.
- I am literally on my own against the whole conservatory, and there is no reason for them to hate me at all. In fact, everything I am doing is because I'm concerned for the safety of the children there, my classmates.
- I am waiting for the Generalitat to come in and sort it out like the adults I assume they are.

!!! important
    - It's key to note that no-one spoke to me at all about anything that was going on, right from the moment I came back.
    - There was a wall of silence around me.
    - The only person who ever said anything to me about anything that was going on was Paqui. One of which was in class sometime in February 2024, when she casually remarked after I told her how stressed I was feeling because of being terrorized that, "oh it's what the men do here".

## Weird guy at conservatory

- I'm stalked continuously online and in the town and at the conservatory.
- I often see the weird guy milling around that I noticed at the [mobile phone shop](october.md#telecommunications-shop).
- I'm quite sure he's either the engineer that has been interacting with me online - who possibly calls himself David - or I'm supposed to think he is.
- I wonder if he is a computer technician at the conservatory.
- I would recognize him in an instant.

## Tonya

- Fake accounts and interactions online keep mentioning the name Tonya.
- Often, when I walk back home from the conservatory through the tunnel, I see a woman being led along by a small slim-built man.
- She is always grinning rather inanely but behind the grin I see fear.
- She is frogmarched into bumping into me at times, and always is led about in such a way so that I notice her.
- I wonder if she's Tonya. She seems high on something.

## Ana in the blue van

- I'm coming back from the shops one Saturday in the car.
- As I'm driving through Cami de la Bota towards home, the [blue car](october.md#trumpet-teacher-drives-past-me-in-his-car) is driving towards me.
- I see Ana in the passenger seat, she looks embarrassed.
- There is NO-ONE in the driver's seat. Whoever was driving has ducked down behind the seats, and is driving extremely slowly, and I cannot see anyone in the driver's seat.
- It certainly could not be the trumpet teacher as he is quite a large man and he would probably find it quite hard to hide his bulk.

## Dreaming of Jesus Christ

- I dream of dirty brown apartments and criminal activity.
- It turns into a nightmare and I call out the name of Jesus Christ to help me.
- He comes and states, very loudly, "Vidal Sastre Sanchez Hornero control your sex".
- I'm not sure what this really means until 2025.

## Matthew

- The account `@Matthew49200183` has been following me since August 2023. I'm supposed to think it is the trumpet teacher.
- Here are all our interactions: https://x.com/search?f=live&q=(from%3AMatthew49200183)%20(to%3A1frgvn)&src=typed_query
- The very first time he connects with me, he talks about women being gang stalked: 

![Matthew's first tweet about gang stalking](../../content/tweets/matthew-women-gang-stalking.png)

- Full tweet is here: https://x.com/Matthew49200183/status/1686307743815069696
- As I mentioned, the hair in his profile pic was a memory trigger from a post related to Carmen and the plate lady from July that I was seeing on both the `@jctot19` account, and the `@sinremite` account.
- The picture has changed now to a flag with the same hair.
- On 29th November, just before choir class, there is an interaction with Matthew on Twitter:

![Interaction with Matthew before choir class](../../content/tweets/interaction-with-matthew-right-before-choir.png)

- "But what if a nervous sweaty elephant tells it to me", is in relation to my PTSD reaction towards the trumpet teacher when I tried to talk to him and is a derogatory reference to my weight too. 
- My reaction to "give him a peanut" is ironic, I know I'm being wound up.
- The reply is in reference to pedophiles and voyeurs.
- I'm feeling extremely nervous and anxious. I go to choir.
- I sit down at my usual seat. The woman who plays the French horn sits down next to me stinking of peanuts. She is eating a peanut-butter sandwich of some sort.
- The choir teacher mentions elephants and trumpets and trunks continually throughout the class.
- I wonder who this Matthew actually is. The English is very good.

## Polygon

!!! danger "I start to get targeted at work too"
    - I start a new job at [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), web3 crypto giant, on 1st November as a Senior Technical Writer.
    - It's a great job and I'm very excited about my new role.
    - I was interviewed by [Nadim Kobesi](https://nadim.computer/), apparently an engineer and cryptographer. Every time he speaks, he prefaces his words with "as an engineer", or "as a security expert".
    - Nadim is a weird guy but we have a good relationship.
    - I find out that Nadim was originally hired to work in the zero-knowledge engineering department - the engine room so to speak - and had lasted one week before he was kicked out and into the technical writing team, where he couldn't do much damage I assumed.
    - Nadim is a difficult person; he is rude, weird and inappropriate. He is very loud and doesn't let others speak. Nevertheless we have a good relationship.
    - Everything he says is prefaced with "as a security expert", or similar.
    - I ask him for advice about how to protect my network and devices, and explain a little bit about what's been happening to me, and how it centers around Twitter.
    - He gives me zero advice I didn't know that I couldn't have got from basic information, and I start to wonder about how much of a security expert he really is.
    - He does say he will check out my Twitter account and I give him my account details.
    - From that moment, his demeanor towards me changes and he starts to bully me outrageously. It is so bad, he is fired about 2 weeks later, but not before he has spread the word amongst the business that I am a "transphobe".
    - When I spoke to engineers on the team about him later on, they couldn't believe the guy had got the job. They said he was totally ineffective and impossible to work with and any work he had done they couldn't believe it was so poor.
    - I look him up on Google and find out he is a trained actor with a bachelor's degree from the [National Institute of Dramatic Art](https://www.nida.edu.au/) in Sydney, graduated in 2010, and has been in a number of films. I figure he must be a spy.
    - I wonder how much damage he was able to do in the engineering department in such a short space of time. The tech failed and faltered again and again in early 2024.
    - He certainly added a lot of malicious code to our backend set up which broke our SEO for months before we could figure it out.
    - In any case, from the moment I gave Nadim my Twitter account details, everything changed for me at Polygon. My boss Grace starts to treat me badly. I am no longer given work by Gabriel Silva who I am supposed to be working with closely. Gabriel starts complains about my work, my writing style, and continually puts me down, calls me a single point of failure with team members.
    - It doesn't matter really because in early 2024, 20% of the workforce is made redundant and I move up to team lead so I am really busy and Gabriel not giving me work doesn't impact on my 14 hour days at all. However, had I not gone up, he would have effectively made me a candidate for redundancy very quickly, which I believe was his intention.
    - Instead, my team (who are not really tech writers and don't know the job) starts to mutiny, one of them in particular, Hans Bodani, starts to shout at me in team meetings, get angry with me, complain about things I did not say to my boss, who supports him, and then refuses to communicate with me at all.
    - I ask for help from my managers. I am ignored.
    - The other team member, Anthony Matlala, sides with Hans once he sees I'm getting no support from my managers.
    - On an offsite in Bali in May, I am threatened with sexual violence from a Rust engineer who has started that week. He has clearly been told to target me. Anthony is at the dinner table when this happens. I tweet about it and tell Spanish HR the following morning.
    - At the Bali offsite and in Belgium at EthCC in July, Polygon employees come up to me continually to say, oh I'm sorry you're leaving, which I'm not.
    - My team refuses to communicate with me at all. Meetings are sabotaged by Hans' angry outbursts. I am unable to do my job.
    - An email comes from from Kellie-J Keen as leader of the [Party Of women](https://www.partyofwomen.org/) in UK in June asking if we could like to stand as a candidate for general election.
    - I take 2 weeks off and run a political campaign in North London and come second-to-last in Finchley & Golders Green.
    - I step down as technical writing team lead and Gabriel Silva steps in and gives all work to Anthony and Hans, with me left with nothing to do. Anything I do write he asks Hans to do over. He picks on me in meetings and gives me impossible tasks which I actually complete.
    - By September/October, I'm getting really upset about it and contact HR to start harassment procedures because it's clear to me I'm being shoved out due to my political views.
    - A couple of weeks later they fire me, and the whole team, saying we're redundant, which is not true.
    - They accept in the letter that the dismissal is unlawful.
    - I get a Spanish lawyer who appears to be colluding with the Spanish company so I have to fire them in December 2024.
    - There's a lot more to this story; this is just a quick sketch.
    - Being targeted at my job for being "transphobic", which I'm not, on top of being targeted by criminal gangs of Dénia is really too much for one person to cope with without any support at all.

## Tweets

These are a selection of tweets from this period which relate to everything that has been happening. Most of them have been translated, a lot, so I assume the Spanish are reading them.

Many of these tweets are confirmation of what has been going on.

- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1730335228047056929 -> Domingo's dad is (apparently) a car dealer, he told me in 2014, so I'm literally unable to get my car fixed anywhere without possible ridiculousness occurring.
