# November 2023

## Conservatory

![Sedating teachers and staff at the conservatory](../../content/images/sedating/sedating-3.png)

### Choir

- Choir class continues to be threatening.
- The choir master Salva has created a list of suggestive scores.
- [Nacho](september.md#nacho-tries-to-terrorize-me) pops his nose in all the time and looks at me in a threatening manner. 
- Salva's continuous rant to the class includes comments on trumpets, elephants, trunks, mentions of Vidal (the trumpet teacher's apparent name) and how I'm thinking about him all the time, offensive comments towards me in Valenciano which I don't understand, constant mentions of [going away for the weekend with your boyfriend](october.md#choir).
- Add to that the comments from the Domingo's students which seem contrived and weird.
- The choir teacher makes fun of my name somehow; I don't understand the joke. This goes on continually and even concerns some of the children, particularly the Romanian girl who is Domingo's student; you may remember her from [the concert on the 9th June](june.md#june-9th-piano-concert).

!!! danger "Child safety warning"
    - The Romanian girl's name, Adriana, came up a lot on X.
    - I considered the references to be a warning that she had been targeted by the gangs.

- The French horn player, an adult woman who sits beside me, probably called Vicen, is involved.
- She waits at the stairs to see my reaction to Nacho as he passes by me one evening after class. 
- When I grimace, she is satisfied and leaves.
- Whenever I leave class, I say goodbye to Salva. He ignores me deliberately.
- I'm anxious, a lot, in choir class. 
- It's a really horrible experience but I continue to attend to defend my human right to a music education, something I'm paying taxes for in the Valencian Community; and to watch and take notes on the outrageous behavior by teachers and staff with dwindling hope that the children are safe with these people.

### Piano 

- Piano is good. I enjoy playing. Paqui seems fierce but fair.
- I have no idea how much she hates me and/or what she is planning with all the teachers.

!!! note "In retrospect"
    - On balance, hate is probably not the main motivator for the relentless gang stalking and bullying by teachers at the conservatory at this stage of the game, although it probably helps them find a justification for their outrageous behavior.
    - In fact, my studies at the conservatory were supposed to end definitively on [June 12th](june.md#monday-12th-june-2023), but that didn't happen.
    - The fact that teachers and staff had to continue with their ridiculous charade must have been very annoying and upsetting for them.
    - So, instead of doing the right thing, and letting it all go, and leaving me in peace to play the piano, they decided their best move was to make things decidedly worse for me so that I would definitely leave, have a nervous breakdown, or even kill myself like so many others they knew.
    - Were they getting paid to deliver me, utterly isolated at home, to the honey-trapping gitano sex gangs?

### Harmony

- Harmony class is OK.
- I struggle to understand the content, however.
- My cognitive skills are not what they used to be. 
- Thinking about musical theory - something that came easy not so long before - now takes a concerted effort.
- I no longer sit next to Samuel who helped me in the previous year. 
- I sit on my own and no-one speaks to me.

### Chamber music 

- Chamber music is stressful. 
- The women are play acting they hate me and it's all a bit of a farce.
- Katia brings in a duet from the opera Norma about two women in love with the same man, one has two children with him. The trumpet teacher, allegedly, has two daughters and the reference is that Norma and Adalgisa are Ana and I and we are both in love with the same man.
- I have brought in something equally suggestive. 
- The whole business is ridiculous in the extreme.
- Random students make comments related to my Twitter activity in the halls.
- It's very stressful.
- I am literally on my own against the whole conservatory, and there is no reason for them to hate me at all. 
- In fact, everything I am doing is because I'm concerned for the safety of the children there, my classmates.
- I am waiting for the [Generalitat to come in and sort it out](october.md#first-letter-to-the-generalitat) like the adults I assume they are.

!!! important
    - It's key to note that no-one spoke to me at all about anything that was going on, right from the moment I came back in September 2022.
    - There was a wall of silence around me.
    - The only person who ever said anything to me about anything that was going on was Paqui. 
    - She remarked casually, sometime in February 2024, after I told her how stressed I was feeling because of being terrorized that, "oh it's what the men do here".

## Weird guy at the conservatory

- I'm stalked continuously online, and in the town, and at the conservatory.
- I often see the weird smug guy milling around that I noticed at the [mobile phone shop](october.md#telecommunications-shop).

![Weird guy](../../content/images/smug-twat.png)

- I never saw this man during the 2022-2023 year of studies, but suddenly I'm seeing him everywhere.
- I don't know who he is but I suspect he's either the engineer that has been interacting with me online someone who possibly calls himself David - or I've been triggered online to think that he is.
- I sometimes wonder if he is a computer technician at the conservatory.
- I would recognize him in an instant.

## The laundry

- Another place something was *always* happening to me is at the La Colada laundry.

![La Colada](../../content/images/la-colada.png)

- I took my laundry there, 2 minutes walk from my house, once-a-week to dry it.
- Sometimes there would be strange people in the laundry while I was there; gangs of young men speaking multiple languages, couples having arguments, men being threatening, a woman devastated about something terrible that's happened to her, a man coming in and laughing in an embarrassed manner when he sees me.
- I didn't really think anything of it until around November 2023.
- I do know that whoever is watching me 24-7 knows where I am at any given moment. 
- They also probably know when I'm planning to go to the laundry as I have my bag of damp clothes ready at my front door.
- During the months of January to April 2023, I remember that every time I went to the laundry I felt nervous and tense. 
- I was loop-thinking about the trumpet teacher and stressing about the chamber music class coming up the next day.
- Sunday night was always when I felt particularly unwell at home.
- I wasn't able to do [my homework properly](may.md#did-the-harmony-teacher-know-i-was-being-poisoned-at-home) on those evenings with a giant cup of tea, and I always felt unstable and tired. I often napped on those evenings.
- It was on Sunday evenings also that I might [walk into town](september.md#gypsy-serenades) and maybe [bump into someone](september.md#rosa-vidal-follows-me-around) or experience some other [menacing situation](../2024/april.md#the-trumpet-teacher-in-denia).
- I often chatted with the lovely man who worked at the laundry, but sometimes even he said things to me which suggested he knew exactly who I was and what I was experiencing.
- One particular time was in [October 2024](../2024/october.md#sunday-6th-october) when I saw the possum-man at the beach and was [offered a job working for this `Caesar`](../2024/october.md#job-offer), as they called him online when I got home.
- Remember I had inexplicably been seeing [possums online for over a year](may.md#possums) by that time.
- The evening after I had seen this guy at the beach, and gone to the laundry as normal; the owner of the laundry had asked me "¿Todo claro?"; meaning is everything clear now?
- I'm not sure what exactly was supposed to be clear.
- At that time, I was being [seriously poisoned at home](../2024/october.md#serious-poisoning-with-intent-to-harm-or-kill) and felt extremely unwell, especially around my kidneys, and facial, neck, and spinal nerves. I was also having raging migraines and problems with my eyes.
- I saw a woman who looked like Carmen Cano with another woman I'd recognize coming out of my building and smiling at me.
- I realized [some months later](../2025/february.md#collecting-my-things) that I had been hallucinating quite badly in my apartment in October 2024 prior to leaving Dénia; specifically regarding a large hole I had seen in the bathroom wall behind the mirror where I believed a camera had been fitted and removed. 
- The hole was tiny when I saw it again the following February; my mind detoxed, sober, and unpoisoned.
- I believe that the Cano's had intended to finish me off in October 2024. 
- I'd already been in a film that was published online where I talked about being poisoned and my apartment set up with spy-cams.
- I had started to speak a lot about how teachers and staff at the conservatory were involved in serious crimes against students.
- It must have annoyed them. 
- My landlady's reaction to the film was priceless; a slow clap.
- Was I also being warned by the numerous good folk in Dénia that the Canos intended to murder me in the only way they could do so without being plain and putting their own lives in danger?

## The Adams family

- I start to see a transformer figure on the `@jctot19 x` search results.
- The character looks like a fierce and angry Ana Girbes carrying big guns.
- The likeness to Ana Girbes, the musical language teacher at the conservatory, is startling.

![Ana transformer](../../content/images/ana-transformer.png)

- This character remains in search results for a few months.
- Paqui Fornet insists I attend one of Ana's concerts which is taking place in the conservatory room 5 one evening.
- I go along.
- Ana Girbes has her elementary class playing *The Adams Family* theme tune on various percussion instruments.

![The Adams Family](../../content/images/the-adams-family.png)

- There are about 10 players made up of very young prepubescent children.
- It should be a fun occasion but Ana looks furious.
- I'm honestly quite amazed but I have no idea what any of this means, at the time.
- Was Ana Girbes trying to tell me something?
- Or had the Spanish gangs started trying to deflect any blame to come onto the British gangs?

## Tonya

- Fake accounts and constant online communications with nefarious players keep mentioning the name *Tonya*.
- I don't know why.
- Often on a Monday evening, when I walk back home from the conservatory through the tunnel, I see a woman being led along by a short wiry man.

![Tonia](../../content/images/tonia.png)

- She is always grinning rather inanely, but behind the grin I see fear.
- She is frogmarched into bumping into me at times, and always is led about in such a way so that I notice her and her lack of autonomy.
- I wonder if she's Tonya. 
- She seems like she could be high on something.
- The following summer, another candidate for [who Tonya could be](../2024/august.md#photos-of-abused-women-and-girls) pops up every day on numerous fake accounts.

![Who is Tonya](../../content/images/targeted-women/innocent-lady/1.png)

- One wonders if this is another attempt from the Spanish and British porn gangs operating in Dénia to deflect any blame coming their way onto the trumpet teacher's pimping gang from Valencia?

## Ana in the blue van

- I'm driving back from the shops one Saturday afternoon around 4pm.
- As I'm driving through the [Cami de la Bota](https://www.google.com/maps/place/D%C3%A9nia,+Alicante,+Spain/@38.8407484,0.0914185,3a,90y,10.27h,79.58t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sOC2bNIiq-bCjgi3TQT8KPQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D10.419428736231623%26panoid%3DOC2bNIiq-bCjgi3TQT8KPQ%26yaw%3D10.274182411708704!7i16384!8i8192!4m6!3m5!1s0x129e1b226dfbd341:0x86f3d778aff1e134!8m2!3d38.8387992!4d0.1050557!16zL20vMDFoc2Ri?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYxNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) towards home, I see the [blue Fiat Doblo](october.md#the-trumpet-teacher-drives-past-me-in-his-car) driving towards me.
- This is the trumpet teacher's car, [I've been led to believe](october.md#the-trumpet-teacher-drives-past-me-in-his-car).
- I see Ana Requena - the violin teacher who was tasked to relentlessly play-act she was having a relationship with the trumpet teacher - in the passenger seat.
- She looks embarrassed.
- There is NO-ONE at all in the driver's seat.

![Ana in the car with no driver](../../content/images/ana-in-the-car-no-driver.png)

- Whoever is driving has ducked down behind the seats, and is driving extremely slowly.
- It certainly could not be the trumpet teacher as he is quite a large man and he would find it impossible to hide his bulk.
- Whoever it is, is small enough to duck down and not be seen.
- It turns out that behind the wheel is Ana's boyfriend, the short man I [saw at the cafe with Paul and Alex](september.md#alex-and-paul), and the same man I see with Ana on [the Montgo the next May](../2024/may.md#climbing-the-montgo).
- It is such a weird event, I tell many, many people about it.
- The blue car meme remains part of the choreographed terror going forward, and even after this ridiculous behavior I'm still expected to think the car belongs to the trumpet teacher.

## Dreaming of Jesus Christ

- I dream of dirty brown apartments and years of devastating criminal activity.
- The dream turns into a nightmare.
- I call out the name of Jesus Christ to help me.
- JC comes and states, very loudly, [**Vidal Sastre Sanchez Hornero control your sex**](../../conclusion/theories.md#vidal-sastre-sanchez-hornero-control-women-and-girls).

![JC holds the door open](../../content/images/jc-holds-the-door-open.png)
 
- I wake up and tweet about it.
- I wonder if this was after another sedating event as I seem to be unusually inspired to tweet my dreams on certain nights, and I have to wonder about it now as this only ever happened when I was living in my apartment in Carrer Furs.
- I'm not sure what  JC's statement means until 2025, but I often pondered the use of the third-person verb form for "control" which was unequivocal in the dream.
- Perhaps it was obvious but there was clearly a time when I was supposed to know what was meant; and it appears I had to go through some stuff, for his purposes, before I knew.
- I now know that JC was telling me exactly what was happening to me and many other women and girls.
- The VSSH gang, whoever they are - trumpet teachers from bands in Valencia, teachers and staff in the conservatory system of Spain, the Cano-Lopez's specifically, the Smiths of Dénia and their British gang-handlers - seem to all be part of a criminal sex-gang enterprise which prepares, grooms, and sedates women and children for the pleasure of paying porn addicts, often on spy-cam, and they've probably made millions on me *specifically* over the last 35 years.
- I suspect much of the many hundreds of thousands of baby-rape films we hear about in the British courts every week is produced by gangs just like these where women and girls are tricked and/or forced into porn and prostitution, controlled via drugs and fear, and then maybe even forced or manipulated into having children with their "handlers" or [introduction agents](../../crimes/introduction-agents.md).
- Certainly the gang manipulated my mind so effectively with spiked-drugs and online triggering activity, I actually believed I was going to become pregnant with the trumpet teacher and have his baby in 2024.
- Was this a demonstration to me of what they do to women? 
- What could the intention have been to manipulate my mind in this way, a 51 year old woman?
- Were they showing me how they are forced to procure more "product" for use if they get women pregnant and then control their offspring too?
- Are some of the gangs now remorseful after years of a downward spiralling trajectory into producing baby-rape material, the porn that makes them the most money, but remain unable to stop this vile and poisonous activity even if they wanted to?
- Was the whole thing a cry for help, as JC insists it is in A Course In Miracles?
- Curiously, I remain delighted with the idea of getting pregnant, and may well look into it as a reality as it is not out of the question, even at my age.
- Thanks again, criminal fools of Dénia for, yet again, helping me to heal my injured soul!
- Maybe I can help you in return?

## First time they flash up my naked 16-year-old body on X

- It was probably around this time that I first saw a flash of what was obviously my 16-year-old naked body on an X post on my timeline, obviously posted by the hackers.
- My knees were up as if I was in a little ball, but I was lying on my back. 
- My skin was practically blue I was so pale, dappled.
- I may have had my hair in a pony tail. It wasn't clear.
- It was horrifying and I knew immediately that teachers and staff at the conservatory had seen me in rape-gang porn.
- Here's a picture of me around that time, probably taken just a month or so before rape-gangs of North London sedated me and put me in rape-gang porn.

![Wee me](../../content/images/wee-katie.jpeg)

- I still find it really hard to accept that a whole town would feel justified in destroying a person because of something like this happening to them when they were a child.
- Is there anyone decent left in Dénia?

## Meeting Alex for coffee

- I meet Alex fairly regularly for coffee and a chat at the street food market.

![Street food market](../../content/images/street-food-market.png)

- It's nice to have someone to talk to.
- She's the only person I am talking to at the time.
- I'm pretty sure now she was communicating with Hazel Smith, who may well be her landlady.
- I tell her how I'm feeling, how I'm in love with this man the trumpet teacher, how he continues to communicate with me online.
- She asks, "how would you feel if he walked right in now?"
- I look behind as if he is going to walk in.
- I'm scared and anxious.
- I wonder now if she's asking me to see if I would accept a meeting, knowing that I [ran from it previously](june.md#sunday-18th-june-alicante-airport).
- I tell her that the body always knows the truth.
- I imagine that very few "targets" have this sort of conscious awareness so I am being monitored closely.
- I'm guessing the criminal gangs haven't yet given up on relieving me of my wealth in some way.

## Matthew

- The account [`@Matthew49200183`](https://x.com/Matthew49200183) has been following me since August 2023. 
- I'm supposed to think it is the trumpet teacher.
- I'm guessing it is instead managed by the Lopez-Cano's (Domingo & Carmen, probably their mother and aunts too), the Smiths, and maybe sometimes the local trumpet teacher [I see around from time-to-time](october.md#the-trumpet-teacher-drives-past-me-in-his-car), the man [Patricia pointed me out to in November 2022](../2022/november.md#walking-in-benijembla-with-the-english-ladies), the man I recognize somehow but who was definitely not the man who came to class at the conservatory on Monday evenings until [June 12th 2023](june.md#monday-12th-june-2023).
- Here are all our interactions: https://x.com/search?f=live&q=(from%3AMatthew49200183)%20(to%3A1frgvn)&src=typed_query
- Notice the not-so-veiled violence in the content. This matches the Smiths' threatening social media content MO nearly precisely.
- The very first time the account connects with me, it mentions women being gang stalked: 

[![Matthew's first tweet about gang stalking](../../content/tweets/matthew-women-gang-stalking.png)](https://x.com/Matthew49200183/status/1686307743815069696)

- As [I mentioned before](august.md#matthew), the hair in the profile pic was a memory trigger from a post related to Carmen and the [plate lady from July](july.md#plate-lady-later-in-the-month) that I was seeing on both the `@jctot19` account, and the `@sinremite` accounts.
- The picture has changed now to a flag image with the same hair.
- On 29th November, just before I leave for choir at the conservatory, I have an unusual interaction with Matthew on X:

![Interaction with Matthew before choir class](../../content/tweets/interaction-with-matthew-right-before-choir.png)

- "But what if a nervous sweaty elephant tells it to me", is in relation to my PTSD reaction towards the trumpet teacher when I tried to talk to him in class, something I wrote about and so well-known to stalkers.
- It is also a derogatory reference to my weight. 
- There's no reason for me to think the English is coming from a Spanish speaker so I believe they make up false mistakes like "tells it to me".
- My reaction to "give him a peanut" is ironic; I know I'm being wound up by stalkers.
- The reply is in reference to pedophiles and voyeurs; the main theme of the gang-stalking.
- I'm feeling extremely nervous and anxious at home.
- I leave for choir.
- I sit down at my usual seat. 
- Vicen, the woman who plays the French horn, sits down beside me as usual. She's grimacing.
- She stinks of peanuts. 
- She is eating a peanut-butter sandwich of some sort.

![Choir again](../../content/images/choir-again.png)

- The choir teacher mentions elephants and trumpets and trunks continually throughout the class.
- I wonder who this Matthew is. The English is very good.
- I'm pretty sure now, in June 2025, that Sandra and Hazel Smith had been running this account since inception.
- Could this be a bona fide connection between British criminal gangs and the Spanish conservatory system?
- At the time, I'm not sure who it is, so I leave all options, and avenues for communication, open.

## Polygon

!!! danger "I start to get targeted at work too"
    - I start a new job at [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), web3 crypto giant, on 1st November as a Senior Technical Writer.
    - It's a great job and I'm very excited about my new role.
    - I was interviewed by [Nadim Kobesi](https://nadim.computer/), apparently an engineer and cryptographer. Every time he speaks, he prefaces his words with "as an engineer", or "as a security expert".
    - Nadim is a weird guy but we have a good relationship.
    - I find out that Nadim was originally hired to work in the zero-knowledge engineering department - the engine room so to speak - and had lasted one week before he was kicked out and into the technical writing team, where he couldn't do much damage I assumed.
    - Nadim is a difficult person; he is rude, weird and inappropriate. He is very loud and doesn't let others speak. Nevertheless we have a good relationship.
    - Everything he says is prefaced with "as a security expert", or similar.
    - I ask him for advice about how to protect my network and devices, and explain a little bit about what's been happening to me, and how it centers around Twitter.
    - He gives me zero advice I didn't know that I couldn't have got from basic information, and I start to wonder about how much of a security expert he really is.
    - He does say he will check out my Twitter account and I give him my account details.
    - From that moment, his demeanor towards me changes and he starts to bully me outrageously. It is so bad, he is fired about 2 weeks later, but not before he has spread the word amongst the business that I am a "transphobe".
    - When I spoke to engineers on the team about him later on, they couldn't believe the guy had got the job. They said he was totally ineffective and impossible to work with and any work he had done they couldn't believe it was so poor.
    - I look him up on Google and find out he is a trained actor with a bachelor's degree from the [National Institute of Dramatic Art](https://www.nida.edu.au/) in Sydney, graduated in 2010, and has been in a number of films. I figure he must be a spy.
    - I wonder how much damage he was able to do in the engineering department in such a short space of time. The tech failed and faltered again and again in early 2024.
    - He certainly added a lot of malicious code to our backend set up which broke our SEO for months before we could figure it out.
    - In any case, from the moment I gave Nadim my Twitter account details, everything changed for me at Polygon. My boss Grace starts to treat me badly. I am no longer given work by Gabriel Silva who I am supposed to be working with closely. Gabriel starts complains about my work, my writing style, and continually puts me down, calls me a single point of failure with team members.
    - It doesn't matter really because in early 2024, 20% of the workforce is made redundant and I move up to team lead so I am really busy and Gabriel not giving me work doesn't impact on my 14 hour days at all. However, had I not gone up, he would have effectively made me a candidate for redundancy very quickly, which I believe was his intention.
    - Instead, my team (who are not really tech writers and don't know the job) starts to mutiny, one of them in particular, Hans Bodani, starts to shout at me in team meetings, get angry with me, complain about things I did not say to my boss, who supports him, and then refuses to communicate with me at all.
    - I ask for help from my managers. I am ignored.
    - The other team member, Anthony Matlala, sides with Hans once he sees I'm getting no support from my managers.
    - On an offsite in Bali in May, I am threatened with sexual violence from a Rust engineer who has started that week. He has clearly been told to target me. Anthony is at the dinner table when this happens. I tweet about it and tell Spanish HR the following morning.
    - At the Bali offsite and in Belgium at EthCC in July, Polygon employees come up to me continually to say, oh I'm sorry you're leaving, which I'm not.
    - My team refuses to communicate with me at all. Meetings are sabotaged by Hans' angry outbursts. I am unable to do my job.
    - An email comes from from Kellie-J Keen as leader of the [Party Of women](https://www.partyofwomen.org/) in UK in June asking if we could like to stand as a candidate for general election.
    - I take 2 weeks off and run a political campaign in North London and come second-to-last in Finchley & Golders Green.
    - I step down as technical writing team lead and Gabriel Silva steps in and gives all work to Anthony and Hans, with me left with nothing to do. Anything I do write he asks Hans to do over. He picks on me in meetings and gives me impossible tasks which I actually complete.
    - By September/October, I'm getting really upset about it and contact HR to start harassment procedures because it's clear to me I'm being shoved out due to my political views.
    - A couple of weeks later they fire me, and the whole team, saying we're redundant, which is not true.
    - They accept in the letter that the dismissal is unlawful.
    - I get a Spanish lawyer who appears to be colluding with the Spanish company so I have to fire them in December 2024.
    - There's a lot more to this story; this is just a quick sketch.
    - Being targeted at my job for being "transphobic", which I'm not, on top of being targeted by criminal gangs of Dénia is really too much for one person to cope with without any support at all.

## Tweets

These are a selection of tweets from this period which relate to everything that has been happening. Most of them have been translated, a lot, so I assume the Spanish are reading them.

Many of these tweets are confirmation of what has been going on.

### @1frgvn

#### Elon's violinist

- Most curiously, in early November, Elon Musk posts an animation with a beautiful violinist and the music is honky-tonk piano: https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1720720258095341916?lang=en.
- Of course, the references to Ana Requena and myself are not lost on anyone.

[![Elon's violinist](../../content/tweets/october-2023/elons-violinist.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1716247635181326437)

- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1730335228047056929 -> Domingo's dad is (apparently) a car dealer, he told me in 2014, so I'm literally unable to get my car fixed anywhere without possible ridiculousness occurring.
- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1730325008625398153 -> the `@g_lamarche` account is likely Domingo and came up on the Google search for `@jctot19` at some point to inform me of it.
- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1729784281482907991 -> Carrie 2 in reference to June 12 Carrie 1.
