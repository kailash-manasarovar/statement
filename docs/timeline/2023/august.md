## France 

- I'm spending the rest of the summer in France, right up to the end of August.
- I have spent one week in Lourdes already before I head up to Cauterets.
- The online activity intensifies and I'm starting to realize people are watching me continuously online.
- I connect with an old friend on Facebook, Matthew Copeland, and tell him I believe I have an audience on Twitter so I'm DJ'ing to them.

!!! tip
    - Contact me for full access: info@forgivenet.co.uk

- There are some weird things too which don't make sense, such as confusing access issues with my Skype account, strange messages on Twitter.
- In truth the hackers are upping the game and getting ready to reveal themselves.

## Fighting back

- I realize that Domingo and the trumpet teacher are continuing to harass me online, so I decide to fight back.
- I find myself still thinking about the trumpet teacher constantly and, given it's not possible for me to be drugged, I now believe that, on top of the drugging, there was some NLP triggering mechanisms being built into my Twitter usage which could be relied upon to trigger sexual feelings in the absence of medication, and which had been set up during those medicated times.
- Also, I wonder if there was some low level, sub-audio sexual sound files being generated through my phone (which I have safely stored so the police cyber experts can check the caches for evidence of this). 

!!! danger "In retrospect"
    - Now, January 2025, I also realize that criminals of Denia had been accessing my apartment and adding poisons and drugs to my bathroom products, and food and water. So, continued sexual feelings could also be explained by this.

- This may explain unpredictable sexual feelings I was having throughout this month in various situations away from Twitter, and there is a possibility that such a thing affected one other person too, details of which I will forward if necessary.
- I start playing a lot of music on Twitter, I add links from YouTube while listening to it with my earphones, and I'm often dancing around my room in Cauterets.
- I'm stalked by accounts on YouTube which you can see in the [August twitter doc](../../content/tweets/august-2023-twitter.pdf).
- I'm thinking about 1989 constantly, and specifically all the music from that time.

## I take a picture of myself in my pants

- I want to check to see how big my bum is, but the mirror is very small, so I stand on a chair and take a photo with my mobile phone.
- This picture is eventually posted on Google search, probably around December 2023, in the "Google search result manner" I explained before. At the time they posted it, they wanted me to know how much content they had taken of me without my knowledge. 

![Me in my underwear Google search](../../content/images/google-searches/me-in-my-pants.png)

- When I saw this picture of me in my underwear (the top half is not me, the bottom half is), I realized for sure that they had filmed me masturbating too. Although I suspected it before, it was evident to me only in suggested ways via gang stalking activity, so I was only 100% sure when they posted this picture in December 2023.
- This pic was up for about a week and then it disappeared and never reappeared.
- I showed it on my mobile to two people who were physically present.

## Cyber-stalking and hacking

- An account starts to follow me after I post the song by Buffalo Springfield, Stop Children What's That Sound: https://x.com/Matthew49200183

![Matthew](../../content/images/fake-accounts/Screenshot 2024-03-08 at 08.46.55.png)

- I know the account is related to what's been going on because the hair in the profile picture - at that time - is the same hair I saw in July when I was seeing a lot of pictures of the ceramics artist and Ana doing modelling. I believe it was just posted on its own like that.
- I have a public tweet conversation with this person which is linked at the bottom of the page along with the other significant tweets.
- I see weird stuff going on with this account, such as my likes being added to posts, without me actually adding them myself. I think it's a glitch.
- We end up DM'ing in December significantly, and for sure it's someone from Denia.
- I take a look at some of the posts on this account and I note extremely enticing, honey-trap-type content from women.
- I often look at my phone during the day. 
- As I'm looking at YouTube on the desktop one day I notice a video in the bottom section of the page which looks like me while I'm looking at my phone, singing along to the song I'm listening to. I'm startled.

## Fake accounts

- On my other Twitter account, [@JackChardwood](https://x.com/JackChardwood), I'm followed by fake accounts with names like Ana, Carmen, and some are porn accounts.
- It's important to note that up until that moment, this account was dead, nothing happened on it at all. 
- This was the beginning of the obvious cyber stalking and, specifically, an ongoing porn infestation of my online activity.
- The porn accounts are no longer following me at the time of writing but there were many.
- One was particularly sinister, named Anna in the [August twitter doc](../../content/tweets/august-2023-twitter.pdf). 
- It was kind of demonic, with a woman who had her long thick black hair put all over her face so you couldn't see it, and she was dressed in her underwear, and making sexual suggestions. It was extremely weird actually.
- I noticed also that this account's profile message seemed to suggest a death threat against me.

![Death threat](../../content/images/threats/anti-k-a-death.png)

- "Anti K a muerte" could be read as this account is "anti Katharine to the death".

!!! info
    - Thinking of that particular porn example now, and others like it, it was obvious that I was not actually dealing with just "foolish immature men", there was something much more sinister going on.
     
- Other accounts seemed to be threatening also:

![Threatening account](../../content/images/threats/marc-panico.png)

- Curiously, this account now has completely changed tone: https://x.com/marcop51.
- Some of the fake accounts that follow me are called **Durian**, so I know it's Domingo and his associates.
- Another account is called JungleMary and this is significant because I have been playing a lot of jungle music online and tweeting jungle tracks. I am also devoted to Mary and often tweet about it too.

![Jungle Mary](../../content/images/fake-accounts/mary-just-me.png)

- Also, "just me" is something I have said a lot previously.
- [This document](../../content/tweets/august-2023-twitter.pdf) is a collection of some of those accounts. You will see durian mentioned and also the accounts mentioning dogs is a close relation to Domingo's surnames: Lopez Cano, which have a distinct canine connotation.
- Since I opened a Facebook account for the general election in the UK in June 2024, I have the same sort of spam accounts full of dogs and horses trying to connect with me.

## Tweet translations

- I realize that I can tell when the Spanish are looking at my tweets because they have to expand the details of the tweets in order to translate them to English. 
- You can see how many times this has happened in the Post Analytics.
- [Tweet translation statistics](../../content/tweets/people-translating-tweets.pdf).

## The hackers reveal themselves

- It's getting time to go back to Spain and the cyber-stalking and harassment is intensifying.
- There are a lot of suggestive posts about someone going to be arrested, it's not clear why or what for, but it's clear they mean me.
- I'm starting to see a lot more porn, but also a lot of real-life death and murder videos from accounts I never followed.
- At one point, I'm on my laptop and I lose control of my keyboard, except someone is typing for me instead.
- I tweet "Arrettt-a" to say STOP.

![They have total access](../../content/tweets/took-hold-of-my-keyboard.png)

- I realize with horror they have total access to my laptop, and probably my phone as well.
- I assume it is because my laptop is not very well secured and they got in via the hotel network. I'm very wrong about that but this is what I tell people for a while.
- Accounts full of dogs follow me on my @JackChardwood Twitter account. I assume to reference Lopez Cano, a pun of dog wolf.
- I'm horrified. I send a WhatsApp message to Concha to ask if she thinks they're dangerous. She says no. I'm not convinced.
- I understand from her silence and their audacity that police action will be difficult to obtain. 
- I [send an email to a private detective](../../content/documents/emails/pdick.pdf) in Spain to see if they can help me link these people to crimes against me. They say they cannot help me.
- I send a post on my @JackChardwood account saying I won't go back if I'm in danger, and other things. 
- An account, Sumithra, who follows an account Durian, follows me immediately (screenshots in the [August twitter doc](../../content/tweets/august-2023-twitter.pdf)) and likes every post. I know it's Domingo and the trumpet teacher.
- https://x.com/JackChardwood/status/1696990588628029460

![My posts to Domingo and the hackers](../../content/tweets/Screenshot 2024-11-17 at 15.55.13.png)

- The Sumithra account no longer exists.
- If you look at the accounts that have followed the Sumithra account in the [August twitter doc](../../content/tweets/august-2023-twitter.pdf, you will see they are all dog-related.

## Going public on Twitter

- I don't know what to do, I feel like parasites are all over me and I can't get them off.
- I'm on my way back to Spain and I believe the intensifying harassment is due to them not wanting me to return to Denia.
- There has always been a suggestion that I was targeted for my gender critical beliefs, amongst other things.
- The only possible thing I can do is to go public on Twitter and ask for help, which I do.
- Going public means adding my real name to my Twitter account Dr Katharine Murphy.
- I do that and ask for help and overnight I gain 1000s of followers from the gender critical movement. 
- I feel much much safer.
- At the same time, many, if not a majority of these new accounts are fake accounts managed by the stalkers.

!!! danger "Throwing me to the wolves"
    - A running theme of being thrown to the wolves, first by the English ladies, then by my teachers, and now even by the wolves themselves.
    - At the moment I went public on Twitter, I believe many more criminal gang networks operating on social media were alerted to my presence and vulnerability.
    - So, although I was safer in some respects, I was also in more danger in others.

## More evidence from this period

- [Browser history](../../content/documents/evidence/history.csv).
- [JackChardwood Twitter download]() -> available on request.
- A good sense of what was going on around the end of August and beginning of September can be seen using this [Twitter search: (from:jackchardwood) until:2023-09-10 since:2023-08-29](https://x.com/search?q=(from%3Ajackchardwood)%20until%3A2023-09-10%20since%3A2023-08-29&src=typed_query&f=live). All of these tweets have been translated many times.

## Tweets

These are a selection of tweets from this period which relate to everything that has been happening. Most of them have been translated, a lot, so I assume the Spanish are reading them.

Many of these tweets are confirmation of what has been going on.

I didn't screenshot at that time as it was so bizarre and you would have to be screen-shotting second by second, which is unreasonable to expect.
