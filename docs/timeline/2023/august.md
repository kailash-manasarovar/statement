## France 

- I'm spending the rest of the summer in France, right up to the end of August.
- I have spent one week in Lourdes already before I head up to Cauterets.
- The online activity intensifies and I'm starting to realize people are watching me continuously online.
- There are some weird things too which don't make sense, such as access to my Skype account, strange messages on Twitter.
- In truth the hackers are upping the game and getting ready to reveal themselves.

## Fighting back

- I realize that Domingo and the trumpet teacher are continuing to harass me online, so I decide to fight back.
- I find myself still thinking about the trumpet teacher constantly and, given it's not possible for me to be drugged, I now believe that, on top of the drugging, there was some NLP triggering mechanisms being built into my Twitter usage which could be relied upon the trigger sexual feelings.
- Also, I wonder if there was some low level sound files being generated through my phone (which I have safely stored so the police can check this with their cyber experts). This may explain unpredictable sexual feelings I was having throughout this month in various situations.
- I start playing a lot of music on Twitter, links from YouTube while listening to it with my earphones, and dancing around my room in Cauterets.
- I'm stalking by accounts on YouTube also which you can see in the [August twitter doc](../../content/tweets/august-2023-twitter.pdf).

## I take a picture of myself in my pants

- I want to check to see how big my bum is but the mirror is very small so I stand on a chair and take a photo with my mobile phone.
- This picture is eventually posted on Google search, probably around December 2023, in the manner I explained before to highlight how much content they had taken of me without my knowledge. At that moment, I realized they had me masturbating too, even though this was fairly evident, but only in suggested ways via gang stalking activity so I was only 100% sure when they posted the picture.

## Cyber-stalking and hacking

- An account starts to follow me: https://x.com/Matthew49200183

![Matthew](../../content/images/fake-accounts/Screenshot 2024-03-08 at 08.46.55.png)

- I know the account is related to what's been going on because the hair in the profile picture - at that time - is the same hair I saw in July when I was seeing a lot of pictures of the ceramics artist and Ana doing modelling.
- I see weird stuff going on with this account, such as likes being added to pictures without me actually adding them myself.
- This account follows me constantly and we end up DM'ing in December, but for sure it's someone from Denia talking to me at that time.
- I take a look at some of the posts on this account and I note extremely enticing content from women.
- I often look at my phone during the day. As I'm looking at YouTube one day I notice a video in the bottom section of the page which looks like me while I'm looking at my phone, singing along to the song I'm listening to. I'm startled.

## Fake accounts

- On my other Twitter account, @JackChardwood, I'm followed by fake accounts including porn accounts.
- Some of these accounts are called **Durian**, so I know it's Domingo and his associates.
- [This document](../../content/tweets/august-2023-twitter.pdf) is a collection of some of those accounts. You will see durian mentioned and also the accounts with lots of dogs. Since I opened a Facebook account for the general election in the UK in June 2024, I have the same sort of spam accounts trying to connect with me.

## They reveal themselves

- It's getting time to go back to Spain and the cyber-stalking and harassment is intensifying.
- I'm starting to see a lot of porn but also a lot of death and murder videos from accounts I never followed.
- At one point, I'm on my laptop and I lose control of my keyboard, except someone is typing for me instead.
- I realize with horror they have total access to my laptop, and probably my phone as well.
- Accounts full of dogs follow me on my @JackChardwood Twitter account. I assume to reference Lopez Cano, a pun of dog wolf.
- I'm horrified and this is when I WhatsApp Concha to ask if she thinks they're dangerous. I'm not convinced at her answer.
- I [send an email to a private detective](../../content/documents/emails/pdick.pdf) to see if they can help me link these people to crimes against me. They say they cannot help me.
- I send a post on my @JackChardwood account saying I won't go back if I'm in danger, and other things. An account, Sumithra, follows me immediately (screenshots in the [August twitter doc](../../content/tweets/august-2023-twitter.pdf)) and likes every post. I know it's Domingo and the trumpet teacher.

- The Sumithra account no longer exists.
- If you look at the accounts that have followed the Sumithra account, you will see they are all dog-related.

## Going public on Twitter

- I don't know what to do, I feel like parasites are all over me and I can't get them off.
- I'm on my way back to Spain and I believe the intensifying harassment is due to them not wanting me to return to Denia.
- There has always been a suggestion that I was targeted for my gender critical beliefs, amongst other things.
- The only possible thing I can do is to go public on Twitter and ask for help, which I do.
- I do that and overnight I gain 1000s of followers from the gender critical movement. 
- I feel much safer.
- At the same time, much of these new accounts are fake accounts managed by the stalkers.

!!! danger "Throwing me to the wolves"
    - A running theme of being thrown to the wolves, first by the English ladies, then by my teachers, and now even by the wolves themselves.
    - At the moment I went public on Twitter, I believe many more criminal gang networks operating on social media were alerted to my presence.
    - So, although I was safer in some respects, I was also in more danger in others.
