## France 

- I'm spending the rest of the summer in France, right up to the end of August.
- I have spent one week in Lourdes already before I head up to Cauterets.
- The online activity intensifies and I'm starting to realize people are watching me continuously online.
- There are some weird things too which don't make sense, such as confusing access issues with my Skype account, strange messages on Twitter.
- In truth the hackers are upping the game and getting ready to reveal themselves.

## Fighting back

- I realize that Domingo and the trumpet teacher are continuing to harass me online, so I decide to fight back.
- I find myself still thinking about the trumpet teacher constantly and, given it's not possible for me to be drugged, I now believe that, on top of the drugging, there was some NLP triggering mechanisms being built into my Twitter usage which could be relied upon to trigger sexual feelings in the absence of medication, and which had been set up during those medicated times.
- Also, I wonder if there was some low level, sub-audio sexual sound files being generated through my phone (which I have safely stored so the police can check this with their cyber experts). This may explain unpredictable sexual feelings I was having throughout this month in various situations away from Twitter.
- I start playing a lot of music on Twitter, I add links from YouTube while listening to it with my earphones, and I'm often dancing around my room in Cauterets.
- I'm stalked by accounts on YouTube which you can see in the [August twitter doc](../../content/tweets/august-2023-twitter.pdf).

## I take a picture of myself in my pants

- I want to check to see how big my bum is but the mirror is very small so I stand on a chair and take a photo with my mobile phone.
- This picture is eventually posted on Google search, probably around December 2023, in the "Google search result manner" I explained before. At the time they posted it, they wanted me to know how much content they had taken of me without my knowledge. 

![Me in my underwear Google search](../../content/images/google-searches/me-in-my-pants.png){width=65%}

- When I saw this picture of me in my underwear (the top half is not me, the bottom half is), I realized for sure that they had filmed me masturbating too. Although I suspected it, it was evident to me only in suggested ways via gang stalking activity, so I was only 100% sure when they posted this picture in December 2023.
- This pic was up for about a week and then it disappeared and never reappeared.

## Cyber-stalking and hacking

- An account starts to follow me after I post the song by Buffalo Springfield, Stop Children what's that sound: https://x.com/Matthew49200183

![Matthew](../../content/images/fake-accounts/Screenshot 2024-03-08 at 08.46.55.png)

- I know the account is related to what's been going on because the hair in the profile picture - at that time - is the same hair I saw in July when I was seeing a lot of pictures of the ceramics artist and Ana doing modelling.
- I have a tweet conversation with this person which is linked at the bottom of the page along with the other significant tweets.
- I see weird stuff going on with this account, such as my likes being added to posts, without me actually adding them myself. I think it's a glitch.
- We end up DM'ing in December significantly, and for sure it's someone from Denia.
- I take a look at some of the posts on this account and I note extremely enticing, honey-trap-type content from women.
- I often look at my phone during the day. As I'm looking at YouTube one day I notice a video in the bottom section of the page which looks like me while I'm looking at my phone, singing along to the song I'm listening to. I'm startled.

## Fake accounts

- On my other Twitter account, [@JackChardwood](https://x.com/JackChardwood), I'm followed by fake accounts including porn accounts.
- Some of these accounts are called **Durian**, so I know it's Domingo and his associates.
- [This document](../../content/tweets/august-2023-twitter.pdf) is a collection of some of those accounts. You will see durian mentioned and also the accounts with lots of dogs. 
- Since I opened a Facebook account for the general election in the UK in June 2024, I have the same sort of spam accounts full of dogs and horses trying to connect with me.

## Tweet translations

- I realize that I can tell when the Spanish are looking at my tweets because they have to expand the details of the tweets in order to translate them to English. You can see how many times this has happened in the Post Analytics.
- [Tweet translation statistics](../../content/tweets/people-translating-tweets.pdf).

## The hackers reveal themselves

- It's getting time to go back to Spain and the cyber-stalking and harassment is intensifying.
- There are a lot of suggestive posts about someone going to be arrested, it's not clear why or what for, but it's clear they mean me.
- I'm starting to see a lot of porn but also a lot of real-life death and murder videos from accounts I never followed.
- At one point, I'm on my laptop and I lose control of my keyboard, except someone is typing for me instead.
- I realize with horror they have total access to my laptop, and probably my phone as well.
- Accounts full of dogs follow me on my @JackChardwood Twitter account. I assume to reference Lopez Cano, a pun of dog wolf.
- I'm horrified. I send a WhatsApp message to Concha to ask if she thinks they're dangerous. She says no. I'm not convinced at her answer.
- I understand from her silence and their audacity that police action will be difficult to obtain. 
- I [send an email to a private detective](../../content/documents/emails/pdick.pdf) in Spain to see if they can help me link these people to crimes against me. They say they cannot help me.
- I send a post on my @JackChardwood account saying I won't go back if I'm in danger, and other things. An account, Sumithra, follows me immediately (screenshots in the [August twitter doc](../../content/tweets/august-2023-twitter.pdf)) and likes every post. I know it's Domingo and the trumpet teacher.

![My posts to Domingo and the hackers](../../content/tweets/Screenshot 2024-11-17 at 15.55.13.png){width=85%}

- The Sumithra account no longer exists.
- If you look at the accounts that have followed the Sumithra account, you will see they are all dog-related.

## Going public on Twitter

- I don't know what to do, I feel like parasites are all over me and I can't get them off.
- I'm on my way back to Spain and I believe the intensifying harassment is due to them not wanting me to return to Denia.
- There has always been a suggestion that I was targeted for my gender critical beliefs, amongst other things.
- The only possible thing I can do is to go public on Twitter and ask for help, which I do.
- I do that and overnight I gain 1000s of followers from the gender critical movement. 
- I feel much safer.
- At the same time, many, if not a majority of these new accounts are fake accounts managed by the stalkers.

!!! danger "Throwing me to the wolves"
    - A running theme of being thrown to the wolves, first by the English ladies, then by my teachers, and now even by the wolves themselves.
    - At the moment I went public on Twitter, I believe many more criminal gang networks operating on social media were alerted to my presence and vulnerability.
    - So, although I was safer in some respects, I was also in more danger in others.

All of these tweets have been translated many times.

- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1691954911586517372 -> when I realized there was a two way conversation going on for sure with a bunch of people probably. This was due to interactions from random accounts that were 100% related to the tweet I had just posted. I didn't screenshot at that time as it was so bizarre and you would have to be screen-shotting second by second, which is unreasonable to expect.

Things like this made me think there were two camps to the stalkers, or they just took the piss out of each other constantly.
