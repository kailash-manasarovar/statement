## Hanuman Jayanti

- On April 6th, 2023, I set off for Lourdes for Easter week
- About an hour from home I suddenly started to feel an overwhelming sexual arousal
- I had no idea what was causing this but I knew it was to do with Vidal

## Good Friday

- On April 7th Good Friday I remained sexually aroused and masturbated in my hotel room
- My laptop was open on the desk at the time, camera pointed at the bed

## Easter Saturday

- I met my friend in Lourdes and told her I was in love
- She can confirm how crazy I was
- She told me about Novena's so I bought a Novena candle and started to pray

## Novena

- I prayed for a way to communicate honestly with this man
- It is a 9 day prayer and on day 6 or 7 I was searching for his name in Google and his Twitter account came up, or so it seemed
- I told my friend what had happened and we were amazed
- I followed his Twitter account with my own and he blocked me immediately
- I thought it wasn't his account or maybe he was concerned about being followed by someone who had my political views. He was a school teacher after all

## Back in class

- The next class I had with him he was extremely angry with me
- I knew then it had been his account (except it wasn't of course, or sort of was)

## A week later

- Something got me up in the middle of the night to post a tweet, in Spanish, telling him I liked him
- It was mature and innocuous, and very honest
- I explained I had been sexually abused as a child and this made relationships difficult for me
- The next class I went to at the conservatory it felt like EVERYONE knew, the whole building was hushed
- When I got home that day, his Twitter account posted a beautiful picture which felt like it was for me
- I was extremely high that day, and my kidneys were aching and I had to lie down
- I texted my friend about all this

## Twitter communications

- I knew he was looking at my tweets
- I was looking at his
- A weird sort of communication started up but nothing was ever said in person
- I continued to feel sexually aroused even on the days I never left the house. I tweeted things to that affect
- I also tweeted a lot of irreverent comical things related to sexism and the like
- I was annoyed that this man had clearly read my very personal tweet and was ignoring me
- Even so, on Twitter on this particular account he was suggesting he liked me
- It was confusing with my state of mind and the constant sexual arousal
