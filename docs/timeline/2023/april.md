## Hanuman Jayanti

- On April 6th, 2023, I set off for Lourdes for Easter week.
- It just so happened to be Hanuman Jayanti that day too, a full moon. This is like Hanuman's birthday every year and is celebrated.
- About an hour from home, just outside of Valencia on the AP-7, I suddenly started to feel an overwhelming sexual arousal.
- I had no idea what was causing this but I knew it was to do with the trumpet teacher.
- I felt like the feelings were for him.
- I was out of my mind that day with racing thoughts about love and romance. It was extremely intense.

## Good Friday

- On April 7th, Good Friday, I remained sexually aroused, not to the same extent as the day before in my car however.
- I was staying at the Mercure Hotel, Lourdes.
- Nevertheless, I masturbated in my hotel room. It was the first sexual activity I had had since January 2011.
- My laptop was open on the desk at the time, and the camera was facing the bed. 

!!! danger "Crime alert"
    - This is the first pornographic video the hackers got of me.

- That night I was thinking about music to take to the chamber music class and I got reception to print off some Philip Glass music which I had arranged for two trumpets.
- At the same time, two songs popped into my head:
    - Creep by Radiohead, and
    - Back to Black by Amy Winehouse
- I found arrangements for trumpet and piano for these songs too, and reception printed them off for me.

## Easter Saturday

- I met my friend in Lourdes and told her I was in love.
- I couldn't stop talking about the thoughts that were racing through and looping around my mind. 
- She can confirm how crazy I was about all this and for how long too.
- I was talking about having babies and getting married. It was absurd and unhinged.
- She told me about Novena's so I bought a Novena candle and started to pray.

## Novena

- I prayed to Mary to ask her to give me a way to communicate honestly with this man.
- At that time, I wrote everything down on notes in my computer, including the things I was going to ask for in prayer, and all the things I wanted to happen in my life. 

!!! danger "Criminal activity"
    - Given that Domingo Lopez Cano and his associates, including his family and teachers and staff at the conservatory, had total access to my online activity, they knew everything that was going on for me privately; all my private desires and wishes, everything I was doing privately and publicly online, and including my prayers to Mary.
    - It's important to keep this in mind as we go through the events.

- The Novena is a 9 day prayer. On day 6 or 7, I was searching for his name in Google again, and his Twitter account came up, or so it seemed: `jctot19`.
- The larger profile pic certainly looked like it could be him.

- I told my friend what had happened and we were amazed. It was a miracle!
- I followed his Twitter account and he blocked me immediately.
- I consequently thought it wasn't his account after all, or maybe he was concerned about being followed by someone with my political views on gender ideology in schools. He was a school teacher after all!

## Back in class

- The next class I had with him he was extremely angry with me for no apparent reason at all.
- I knew then it had been his account I had found (except it wasn't of course, or sort of was).

## A few days later and the next class

- Something got me up in the middle of the night to post a tweet, in Spanish, on my Twitter account that told him I liked him.
- It was mature and innocuous, and very honest.
- I explained I had been sexually abused as a child and this made relationships difficult for me.
- The next chamber music class I went to at the conservatory it felt like EVERYONE knew what I had written, the whole building was hushed.
- His demeanor towards me was kind in class that day and this was probably the most powerful grooming technique of all because for the first time in my life, on disclosing sexual abuse to someone I cared about as I did:
    - I was not judged.
    - I was no hated or attacked.
- When I got home that evening, his Twitter account posted a beautiful picture which felt like it was for me.
- I was extremely high that day, and my kidneys were aching after class, and I had to lie down.
- I texted my friend from Lourdes about all this.

## Twitter communications

- I knew he was looking at my tweets, even though he had blocked me. Back then, this was possible on Twitter.
- I was looking at his tweets on another browser where I was not logged in.
- Bare in mind that all this was obvious from the hacker's perspective.
- A weird sort of communication started up, an exchange of symbolic messages via tweets, but nothing was ever said in person.
- I continued to feel sexually aroused, even on the days I never left the house. I tweeted many things to that affect.

!!! info "My tweets related to sexual arousal April-June 2023"

- I also tweeted a lot of irreverent comical things related to sexism and the like
- I was annoyed that this man had clearly read my very personal tweet and was ignoring me
- Even so, on Twitter on this particular account he was suggesting he liked me
- It was confusing with my state of mind and the constant sexual arousal
