## Twitter

- The suggestions were things like he was coming over, we would go out, he would ask me out, he really liked me
- I tweeted irreverence back

## Penultimate class

- The class is just me and him alone
- I bring a couple of tunes to play, Creep and Back to Black
- Creep is for Domingo
- Back to Black is for Vidal with regards to Ana his (apparent) girlfriend
- I'm aware everything is a big joke but I'm not aware of the extent of it. I mistakenly believe that only Domingo and his close associates are scheming against me, and perhaps Vidal doesn't want to be a part of it, and Ana is just a lie ... it's all very confusing actually
- I'm aware something's going to happen at the end of the year on the last class and I tweet about that

## Last class

- My humiliation on Monday 12th June
- I bring Vidal a present to say thanks, a little wooden frog instrument, and he tried to kiss me and I flinch away
- We play Creep and My Way
- On playing My Way, Vidal blows his trumpet very angrily in my ear and start marching up and down angrily, humiliating me
- Everyone has their phones out recording
- Gloria is practically wetting herself with laughter
- I'm not at all surprised at any of it
- I walk out of the conservatory and they throw dirty water (I hope) onto me from an upstairs window (Ana's classroom actually)
- I still have the t-shirt with stains on that they ruined
- As I walk home, I "bump" into Mercedes who I realise was waiting for me the other way I walk home and when she realised I'd gone a different way she'd had to run. She was totally out of breath and trying to style it out
- She was checking if I was crying
- I got home and went onto twitter and tweeted something like "well that was a crappy ending wasn't it"
- Suddenly a huge number of people start retweeting this post and I discover I'm on a list of around 30 people and they're all laughing at me
- That was shocking and unexpected, but not in retrospect now I understand the full extent of what was going on

## Tuesday 13th June

- I go to acupuncture and I'm traumatized
- She tells me I have diabetes which I know fully well is a lie
- There is a storm and lightning destroys a tree outside
- I leave for Ireland and there are rainbows all over the region. I take it as a good sign

## Monday 19th June

- I go to practice the piano at the conservatory
- This was not what they intented, and I knew that very well
- I still couldn't believe that everyone would want me out. There was no reason for it, so I went back
- I'm also stubborn and deeply against injustices of all kinds
- I walk my talk as much as possible

## Twitter

- I'm still having this weird "communication" with the account I think is Vidal's account
