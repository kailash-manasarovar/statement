# September 2023

## Praying at Cauterets

- On Friday 1st September, I'm thoroughly convinced something bad is going to happen to me when I return to my home in Dénia.
- I offer Domingo trauma healing sessions on X in return for safe passage in Dénia.

![Safe passage](../../content/tweets/august-comms/offering-domingo-healing.png)

- I also go to the church at Cauterets to pray with Sally.

![L'eglise at Cauterets](../../content/images/cauterets-eglise.jpg)

- We discover that Sainte Bernadette came to Cauterets to take the cure three times, and she visited the church often to pray.
- There is a little altar set up for her.

![Bernadette's altar](../../content/images/bernadettes-altar.jpg)

- I get goose bumps.
- Before I head off to Spain, I go to the grotto at Lourdes to ask for Our Lady's protection from evil men.
- She supplies.

## Going public on Twitter

- I'm on my way home. 
- I will stop for one night in Zaragoza because it's a long drive.
- I don't know what to do. I'm extraordinarily stressed and anxious.
- I feel like parasites are running all over me and I can't get them off. 

!!! tip "Parasite baths"
    - I still feel like this in May 2025.
    - I've kinda got used to it because I've had to accept that this is no ordinary situation.
    - God's got my back though.
    - I hear that crows use this sort of thing for positive outcomes.
    - So will I.

    ![Ant baths](../../content/images/crow-takes-ant-bath.jpg)

- I believe the intensifying harassment and terror is because Domingo and his associates do not want me to return to Dénia.
- I feel that something awful is going to happen to me on Monday 4th September at home in Spain, possibly that I will be arrested but I don't know what for.
- It is exactly the same way I felt when I thought was [going to be arrested and go to prison for 7 years](july.md#the-first-time-i-become-terrified-about-being-arrested) in Thailand.
- It is also the same feeling of dread I experienced on the weeks of run-up to [chamber music class on 12th June](june.md#monday-12th-june-2023); my 'funeral' apparently.
- There had always been an online suggestion that I was targeted for my gender critical beliefs.
- I suddenly remember that there *had* been a girl who thought she was a boy at the conservatory, and her name was indeed Silvia.

![Silvia](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/silvia.png)

- I put two-and-two together and make an assumption that I'm going to be arrested for my *transphobic* views on Twitter which teachers and staff at the conservatory have been sharing with everyone in the town.
- I make an initial plea for help before I leave Cauterets for Zaragoza.

![Asking for help](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/asking-for-help.png)

- I really believe I am in danger.
- When I arrive in Zaragoza and settle in my hotel room on Saturday 2nd September, I tweet about my feelings of threat and dread so there will be something in writing which may serve as an explanation if anything does happen to me.

![Great harm is intended for me](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/i-believe-great-harm-is-intended-for-me.png)

- I remain unsettled and anxious.
- I go to bed scared.
- Something pulls me out of bed about an hour later.
- I'm so concerned that something bad is going to happen to me, I go public on X which means I add my real name to my account, Dr Katharine Murphy.
- I then ask for help again.

![Going public](../../content/tweets/tweet-that-went-viral.png)

- The tweet goes viral.
- Overnight I gain 1000s of followers from the gender critical movement. 
- I feel much, much safer.

### New followers 

- A great many of these new follower accounts are fake accounts managed by the cyber-stalking criminals.
- So, although I was safer in some respects, I was in more danger in others.
- Some new followers have [profile pics of the faces of teachers and staff](../../crimes/protagonists.md) at the conservatory of Dénia.
- From this moment onwards, the English language of the stalker accounts becomes fluent, native, and vernacular. 
- In retrospect, I'm convinced this is when [Hazel Smith](../early-years/2007.md#hazel-smith), her family, and her local English-speaking associates, such as [Patricia and Christine](../2022/november.md#walking-in-benijembla-with-the-english-ladies), step in.
- I guess many more criminal gang networks operating on social media were alerted to my presence and vulnerability.
- In September 2023, however, I have no idea Hazel and Sandra Smith are involved, and have been involved in the story since 2006. This key to the story starts to come out in a rather curious way about a month later.
- At the time, I believe the wild interest on my *tweet-for-help* and the sudden 1000s of followers I gained were mostly genuine. 

## Immature boy, bad companions, or both?

- When I get home on Sunday 3rd at around 5pm, an account has followed me, **kaka**.

![Admission of guilt](../../content/images/admission%20of%20guilt.png)

- I've pasted the full profile in the [August twitter doc](../../content/tweets/august-2023-twitter.pdf).
- *kaka* or similar is a way the cyber-stalkers refer to me; even the choir master in year 4 of professional studies will do so blatantly to my face.
- The profile message is very interesting.
- I suspect that someone got momentarily concerned about the ramifications of what had [been happening online](#going-public-on-twitter), and were worried about officials getting involved.

![Tell her something](../../content/images/tell-her-something.png)

- It seems like a message intended to deflect the blame off Domingo Cano Lopez and onto unknown associates.
- The message is completely opposite to the very intentional terror I was experiencing online only days before, and over the previous 8 months, which told me something very different indeed.

## Shunned by international feminists

- Well known feminists reach out to me to see if they can help.
- I cannot be clear with them about what the Dénia hackers are going to do because it is all suggestions from ramped up threats online.
- I explain I've been terrorized for nearly a year by teachers and staff at the conservatory, and relentlessly online too.
- They decide unilaterally I'm lying and that I'm not to be trusted.
- One woman upsets me enormously by telling me, "you're not being hacked", as if it's all in my mind. She then tells me I'm lying and I should get help! 
- This was extraordinarily triggering and so unbelievable I started to think that the woman I was talking to was not who she said she was. 
- I still wonder I'm so flabbergasted.

![Discredited by well-known feminists](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/discredited-by-well-known-feminists.png)

- I realize that feminists can be as misogynist as everyone else. I knew that anyway.
- Nevertheless, it was extremely upsetting and eyeopening.

![Curious ironies](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/curious-ironies.png)

- I will meet some of the Spanish feminists who were involved in discrediting me in [April 2024 in Madrid](../2024/may.md#madrid) when I tell my story at Let Women Speak.
- I'm told that people thought I was an unbalanced, domestic-violence victim and for that reason my request for help was ignored and I was discredited.
- I'm agog!!
- I'm told more recently that some of those feminists have links to Spanish misogynist networks that would have been extremely keen to keep what's been going on in Dénia, and no doubt elsewhere, very quiet.
- I guess they were just doing what they were told, like *good* women do, and were believed by everyone else.

!!! important "Full disclosure"
    - Contact me for full access to any emails, letters, documents, etc.

- I continue to send Raquel updates, including copies of police statements.
- She ignores me.
- It seems to me that the possibility of a lone woman being terrorized by a whole town is common knowledge in Spain, accepted and protected, just normal daily events for a deeply misogynist culture.
- Protecting the gangs might have worked well prior to the porn-epidemic with growing pedophilia requirements alongside the mass access to home networks of unsuspecting victims.
- Remember. *Everyone* knows me in Dénia. 
- I myself know no more than a handful of people.

## X.com

- The following section lists some of the more interesting tweets from this period.

### `@1frgvn`

[![You know it's God](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/you-know-its-god.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1698090627513143314)

- This is a report on the times I saw the trumpet teacher in the Peugeot. Once, on [June 11th](june.md#sunday-11th-june) and again later in the month with the [doctor at the beach](june.md#the-trumpet-teacher-and-the-doctor-joan-drive-past-me).

[![Bashed up 2-door Peugeot](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/bashed-up-2-door.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1698220957368725524)

- Given I'm being discredited massively, I try to defend myself a little.

[![Police checks](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/police-checks.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1698130639751348474)

- I'm sure another crucifixion is coming up, just like my first on [12th June 2023](june.md#monday-12th-june-2023). My consequent resurrection is encouraging to me, I must say.

[![Second crucifixion fears](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/second-crucifixion-fears.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1698242524786167834)

- I remain astounded at the behavior of teachers and staff at the conservatory.

[![Amazement at their evil](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/amazement-at-behavior.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1698243011077915035)

- The online support I received was miraculous and my stress levels came down and my nervous system had a short time to repair.

[![Online support](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/a-short-rest.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1698586936363843958)

- I continue to try and explain what's been going on and why I'm scared. It's only over a year later I start to realize I've been subject to some kind of manipulating hypno-tech used by criminals, terrorists, pornographers, pimps, and honey-trappers which is often reinforced with drugs.

[![Trying to explain myself](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/non-specific-terror.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1698607627582746894)

- It's hard to understand why feminists would dismiss me unilaterally.

[![Dismissive feminists](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/trying-to-understand-feminists.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1698679791346417766)

- Someone wants to know why I hadn't contacted the major feminist organizations in Spain. It wouldn't have been worth the upset at the time. Eventually I did and I was unilaterally ignored by everyone, even when I was telling them I was being poisoned. No-one, including police, wanted to know.

[![Contacting feminist organizations in Spain](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/major-feminist-groups-in-spain.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1698894244272837094)

- I deliberate with new X contacts how the hackers got into my devices.

[![Hackers got in on the hotel network](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/deliberations.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1699358345814061079)

- I continue to wind-up my stalkers.

[![Winding up the stalkers](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/winding-them-up.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1699700177223766346)

- On 7th September I report the fight within me again (in reply to a stalker account).

[![The fight is in me](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/the-fight-is-in-me-again.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1699776148635516933)

- Wondering why these men are so unwell.

[![Really very sick men](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/mras.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1700184266452169193)

- I often take the opportunity to remind these people that God's in control of it all.

## Google search

- On the `@jctot19` results, I start to see a photos of documents coming from the Generalitat Valenciana.

## The evil eye

- On Monday 4th September, I go to the supermarket, Mercadona, five minutes walk from my house.
- A car pulls up alongside me and drives slowly, the driver and the passenger, a man and a woman glaring at me angrily.
- I tweet about it.

[![The evil eye](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/the-evil-eye.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1698643045506310256)

- This is the beginning of a *new normal* for me.
- I experience similar activity from random people I don't know every time I leave my house from this moment until I leave the town with my toxic belongings in February 2025.

## A hacker takes control of my mobile phone

- The following few days after I arrive home, I notice men outside my apartment on the street hanging around fiddling with handheld devices.
- I believe they are accessing my network somehow.
- On Wednesday 6th September, I am talking with my friend - a Tibetan monk - on my mobile phone through WhatsApp. 
- I'm explaining to him what's been going on and how scared I am, and he suggests he comes to visit me.
- I say yes, please do come.
- At that moment, I lose control of my mobile phone completely. Every key I press, does something entirely different. The whole screen is scrambled.

[![My mobile is hacked](../../content/tweets/september-23-comms/mobile-hacked.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1699346455109030341)

- I turn off the router and regain immediate control of my phone.
- I believe the activity outside my house was to *get me to think* that hackers are external to my network, when in reality they gained access to my devices directly through the router, with Mac spoofing or similar, using information known only to either the telecommunications company, Telco, or the ISP itself, which at that time was Yoigo.

## Rosa in town

- Whenever I walk into Dénia, I see Rosa Vidal, Director of the Conservatory of Dénia, who often nearly bumps into me but never says hello or acknowledges me.
- She's doing it on purpose.
- On one occasion she is sitting outside a shop I come out from next to a man resembling the trumpet teacher.
- It frightens me.

## Problem with the car washer

- The caretaker at Carrer Furs, Pedro, informs me there is a leak in my car washing fluid. I see the blue fluid all over the floor in the garage where I park my car. I think it is to do with a small bump on the road in France.
- He suggests I take the car to his friend who is a mechanic. I'm reluctant.
- I tell Pedro about being bullied by the conservatory.
- Instead, I take it to a garage in Javea who make me wait all day and do nothing at all, and charge me for it too.
- I realize I cannot take my car to any garage within about 100 miles radius, or more.
- Domingo's dad is in the car business and I wonder if I met him in 2012 when I had a flat battery when I lived in the Passeig Periodista Ramon Ortega.

## The water pipes

- Pedro had always been really keen to tell me about the water pipes coming into the flat and the fact that they were broken.
- I had raised this with the landlady in July 2023 when I was going away for the summer but she ignored me.
- I raised it again in 2024 on WhatsApp and sent her a picture. She said "perfecto".

![The broken water pipe outside my apartment](../../content/images/water-pipes.JPG)

- On the day Pedro was fired, and he was showing the new caretaker around the apartments, he took pains to tell me that the water pipes were not only broken outside my door (see picture below) but also at the ground floor level where the mains water is distributed to all the flats in the building.
- He pointed out that every pipe was fine, except mine. He was very insistent I knew about this. He hadn't been previously.
- It's curious that at *both* places you can cut off the mains water into my apartment, it is impossible to do so.
- Even though the water pipe is closed off in the picture, it continues to run into my house.
- Basically, you cannot close off the water pipes to my flat. The water pipe outside the door is broken, and so is the one at the bottom of the building. They are broken in exactly the same way too. So there is no way to close off the water coming from the mains.
- I wonder if this is because, if you are poisoning someone, perhaps in a drip-feed type manner, and they can close off the pipes when they leave the building, then the poison, or narcotic, or whatever, could collect in large doses and kill someone instantaneously. 
- I wonder if that's happened before. I wonder if that's why there is a specific clause about me dying in the apartment in my tenancy agreement. 
- Could the people of Dénia be that evil?
- I believe any of the caretakers at Carrer Furs 13-15 will be able to tell the police how criminals have been able to add poison and narcotics to the water running into my apartment.

## A man I recognize

- I'm leaving my flat to go to the conservatory.
- A man walks around the building and we walk towards each other.
- I feel like I know him. 
- He looks at me like he's trying to avoid eye contact and stifling a smirk.
- He is one of the men I remember being in the bathroom with me in a dream.

## People on the beach

- It's hot and I go to the beach every day in the afternoon.
- I'm followed up and down the beach every day by the same group of people that I begin to recognize each day.

![Beach stalkers](../../content/images/stalked-on-the-beach.png)

- There is a couple, a woman and man, who I see every day milling around me. The man is balding and is wearing dog tags. He has his back to me usually and has his dog tags hanging down the back of his neck on a chain.
- The woman is in her early 50s. I'd recognize her face again. One day I smiled at her and she got really scared, really quickly, and I knew.
- These two were at the [piano concert](../2024/march.md#tuesday-12th-march) at the Casa de Cultura on 12th March 2024.
- One afternoon, I'm walking back along the beach and there's a group of young men sitting on chairs. The couple I've just mentioned is with them.
- As I walk past, the young men start making sexual moaning noises and touching themselves on their chests.

### The man in the Alhambra pic

- A couple of time while I'm stalked up and down the beach at Las Marinas this month I see the very same man from the [July pics](july.md#the-guy-at-the-alhambra) with a woman.

## Smurf cat

- I go to the beach dressed pretty much like Smurf Cat, a meme that appears on my Jack Chardwood twitter account.
- https://x.com/JackChardwood/status/1704386000493887568.
- Of course, a play on words of my name.
- https://x.com/Smurfcatbsc is a copy of the original.
- Smurf cat's hat is like mine that I wear to the beach.

![Smurf cat's hat](../../content/images/smurf-cat-hat.png)

## A handyman comes to fix a minor thing in the bathroom

- At some point this month, the air extractor thing pops out of the ceiling in the bathroom for no apparent reason.

![Air extractor pops out](../../content/images/invented-problem-in-bathroom.jpg)

- I believe now they have come in and done this so I will call Beatrice for a handyman to fix it, which I do.
- A man called Fabio comes to fix it, a handyman +34-727-70-53-89. It is an extremely minor thing that should take 5 minutes.
- He goes into the bathroom and closes the door. He is in there for 30 minutes or so with the door closed.
- I now wonder if he was sent to do something else entirely.
- At the same time, I have to change my driving license to a Spanish one and there is a huge confusion with Northern Ireland and I'm very stressed because no-one is able to help me.
- However, I'm excessively stressed, likely because of what is going on in Dénia, and also because of being drugged somehow, I believe.
- I'm on the phone to someone who is behaving in a particularly unhelpful way at the moment Pablo comes out of the bathroom.
- I'm clearly very stressed and upset.
- He barks at me, "You're sick!".
- It was extremely rude and a very unusual thing to say and I had no idea why he would say such a thing.
- I now believe he knew I was being poisoned and drugged, and was telling me so.
- It was clear he despised me for some reason.
- I saw him around the urbanization from time to time. I now wonder if other flats are being used for similar purposes as mine is.

## Stones thrown at me

- One Saturday I go hiking on the mountain.
- As I'm walking through the town towards the mountain, a car full of young men drives past me.
- I'm hit by stones thrown at me from the car.

## My friend the fruit and vegetable seller

- Turns out, I do have a good friend in Dénia; one of the very few people in the world who I love dearly, and will always love; a woman with strong integrity and a powerful spiritual practice.
- I do not attempt to see her until this time for two reasons. First, I had been depressed and didn't see anyone as a rule. Second, my head was spinning with what was going on for me and it was difficult to know how to deal with anything outside of prayer, and fighting the cyber-stalkers online.
- I hadn't seen my friend since 2016. We only chatted a few times online and I hadn't had any contact with her since 2020.
- She had been selling fruit and vegetables in the market for some years with her new boyfriend who I hadn't met yet.
- A common friend of ours is Klara Sarkadi, the Orfeo choir master who is a close associate of Domingo.
- Klara told me repeatedly how tired my friend was from working in the fields. "She's very tired," she'd say.
- I go to buy some vegetables.
- As I walk towards the stall, I see [Paqui Fornet Pastor](../../crimes/protagonists.md#paqui-fornet-pastor) talking to my friend. She gives me the side-eye and walks away.
- I meet my friend. We hug and exchange a few words.
- She mentions how she and her boyfriend had seen me walking up the Calle La Mar towards the tunnel from the conservatory, on [Monday 12th June in the evening](june.md#monday-12th-june-2023). They had beeped at me. I file this information away.
- I buy some vegetables and leave.
- When I go to cook one of the vegetables, a lovely fresh looking onion on the outside, I find it is rotten to the core.

![Rotten onion](../../content/images/rotten-onion.png)

- I throw it away.
- The next time I see my friend, she asks me if my vegetables were OK in an overly concerned manner.
- I lie and say yes they were fine.
- Did she know my onion was rotten?
- She could only have known that if someone had been watching me in my flat, and made sure she asked me about it.
- It's safe to assume the criminals of Dénia would be over-interested in our relationship and therefore any of our interactions.
- At that moment, I began to become concerned my friend had been tricked too.
- Could she have been enslaved to work in the fields?
- Her man, who was a bit weird with me, is probably about 20 years younger than her, and has delicate hands and doesn't look overworked at all.
- I remembered she was always going to a local psychic/match-maker in 2016 looking for a man, and knowing what I now know about this town and the monstrous but powerful minority in it, I shuddered.
- Another time I go for vegetables, [Thao](may.md#acupuncture-with-thao-qi) is there. Is she waiting for me too? She says, hi, and asks if I went back to classes at the conservatory. I say yes I did, very strongly.
- Another time I go for vegetables, [Domingo](../../crimes/protagonists.md#domingo-lopez-cano) is there, on his own, with the two little girls from Madrid that he teaches.
- I give him a [therapy card](#praying-at-cauterets) in person.
- He shouts, "ooooh, touch", elongating the word *touch* in a salacious manner, and leaves with the girls.
- My friend says, oh you know him, and tell me that she sees him all the time with his daughters.
- I tell her they are not his daughters.
- Alarm flashes across her face.
- The last time I see her, in April 2024, she says, oh I just saw Paqui Fornet, "isn't she a nice person?".
- I tell her I think Paqui is probably a psychopath.

## My friend visits

- My friend the Tibetan monk visits for a few days in September: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1699344886053454116.
- He came at my request when I was being terrorized online and I was very scared and stressed.
- While I'm waiting for him to arrive at Valencia airport, I translate one of the posts I see on the `@jctot19` Google search a lot.

![Igual trasquilaron](../../content/tweets/july-comms/igual-trasquilaron.png)

- It's complicated Spanish but means something like "they thought you were an idiot but you weren't and now they keep making things worse".
- Posts like these make me think this account is the trumpet teacher communicating directly with me.
- We had a marvelous few days together.
- However, one afternoon we are followed along the beach by a group of men who behave extremely strangely. I would remember them again, and I saw one of them in town and I saw two of the others in the laundry one day. 
- One man, bald, 50s, was sitting on a chair close to the water.
- Another man, younger, 40s, dark, fat, wearing khakis and a white vest was roaming around, and he even came right up to where we were sitting and lingered around us close.
- The bald man started to shout at him to move away. He didn't. He was furiously typing on his mobile phone.
- My friend will remember all this as it was extremely odd.
- I stood up to protect our spot somehow and I saw a man walking down the beach towards the town who looked like the trumpet teacher (but wasn't probably, just the same build, too young again).
- On another occasion we became embroiled in choreographed intrigue involving teachers from the conservatory.
- Coming back from Las Rotas, when we got off the bus, Ana the violin teacher "bumps" into us. She's extremely angry. I know it's another choreographed deceit and I know it's all intended for me to see and wonder about, and get stressed about.
- She's timed to meet us at exactly the right moment, and we have been constantly moving through the town and on public transport.
- They knew exactly where I am at any given moment.
- This could only be the case if they had full access to my mobile phone including the location function.
- We see Paqui Fornet too one afternoon. I say "hi" and she ignores me.
- During this time, there is much content related to "pandas" on my account and this, and consequent messages, leads me to believe that this is how they are referring to my Tibetan friend.

## Alex and Paul

- I knock on Paul's door to say hello. He is surprised to see me. He's an old friend from Dénia.
- He puts me and Alex (Alessandra) in contact, another old friend from Dénia.
- I meet Alex and tell her everything that's been happening. I must appear extremely stressed and anxious.
- Myself, Paul, and Alex meet for coffee soon after.
- Paul tells me rather private things that I suspect the stalkers are hoping I'll tweet about.
- I meet Alex a few times over the next months until around March 12th and then I don't really hear from anyone again, apart from Paul who I continue to "bump" into at the Open Market where he's having a beer from time to time.
- These meetings are obviously pre-arranged by others in order to get information from me.
- We arrange to meet for Halloween as we had done in 2007.
- Every time I meet them, people turn up immediately and sit right beside us. I know they're listening to everything we say.
- I now remember that one of these people was likely [the man with Ana on the Montgo in May](../2024/may.md#climbing-the-montgo).
- When I get back home and check Twitter, things the three of us have said in our conversation are posted on fake account profiles.
- This happens with anyone I talk to.

!!! tip "Background"
    - A previously fit and strong woman, around 2008 or 2009, Alex suddenly became unwell with a weird autoimmune thing I can't remember.
    - We weren't socializing at that time but I remember bumping into her and she was extremely anxious and worried about it.
    - She underwent a harsh surgery where she had a full bone marrow transplant around 2009/10 or thereabouts.
    - She survived the surgery but her health was severely affected by it.
    - She was apparently the first person in Spain to have undergone such surgery and the surgeon was a very important and significant man in his field.

## Meeting Christine

- I meet Christine BJ for lunch and tell her everything that's been going on.
- I tell her I think the engineer who is hacking me is called David.
- I'm upset when she laughs at me in a jeering manner when I tell her that the teachers threw dirty water on me from an upstairs window.
- She's really quite blase about it all and rather dismissive. This continues to be her stance as the terror progresses.
- I realize there's really very few people I can trust, if anyone.

## Gypsy serenades through the tunnel

- Every time I walk through the tunnel, there is a gypsy busker playing music related to everything that has gone on with the trumpet teacher.
- One day, three gypsies stand at the end of the tunnel and the young woman sings loudly at me about a lucky frog in a box, and other stuff related to what's been going on.
- I recognize the young woman from an account that followed me on Twitter `@JackChardwood` over the summer when the hacking and stalking was intensifying. The account had a name that included "Suarez".
- This is a more recent fake account with her picture in:

## Year 4 professional piano begins

- I signed up and paid for the course in June, much to everyone's dismay no doubt.
    - [Application form](../../content/documents/papeles-conservatorio/KATHARINE%20MARGARET%20MURPHY%20-%20MATRICULA.pdf).
    - [Proof of payment](../../content/documents/papeles-conservatorio/KATHARINE%20MARGARET%20MURPHY%20-%20pago.pdf).

## Chamber music

- The conservatory chamber music classes begin again and I'm to accompany two singers.
- Katia is, apparently, a friend of Ana and she play acts being really angry with me throughout the course.
- I write to her eventually after she gives me her mobile phone number in December.

### Nacho tries to terrorize me

- In the first class, Nacho the clarinet teacher races in extremely angry and starts talking to the chamber music teacher.
- I know he's trying to upset me.

### Domingo tries to upset me

- After one class, I'm walking away and Domingo is in the middle of the hall. He sees me and walks into a darkened room where one of his female students from Madrid, Lucia, is standing, in the dark.

## Harmony classes

- We have a new teacher, Alfonso, for harmony.
- One afternoon I see him following me around Dénia.
- It's clear that everyone knows what's been going on and has been invited to join in terrorizing the female target of the moment.
- I wear a funny t-shirt to class in an attempt to make light of it all and carry on with my studies.

![Don't poke the bear](../../content/images/dont-poke-the-bear.png)

- I don't realize at this time that the gang stalkers, Domingo and his accomplices, intend nothing less than my total destruction.
- I wonder what they've been told about me that would make them so eager to terrorize me, or whether it's just something they enjoy doing to random people (women and girls) from time to time.
- I now wonder if they were always aware of the sexual grooming and the danger to minors.

## Piano classes

- Paqui Fornet Pastor is my new piano teacher and I really don't expect her to be involved in anything that has been going on.
- It turns out she's a ringleader and the [boat club episode](march.md#choir-rehearsal-at-the-boat-club) must have been a show-and-tell for hubby.

## Choir

- We have a new teacher for choir, Salva Tur, an unpleasant man who thought we would like to hear him talking for 1 hour and 50 minutes of each class and then do 10 minutes of singing. 
- The choir course, aside from the bullying, was excruciatingly boring.
- When I introduce myself as he's going around the class, he grins at me in a knowing way, "oh, you're Katharine".
- A little later he starts singing "it's too good to be true".
- That evening on Twitter, an account named Salva, posts a dick pic.
- I mention [dick pics on Twitter in January 2024](../2024/january.md#dick-pics-from-the-choir-master), right before choir class.

## Apes beating their chests

- I'm walking home with my Indian takeaway one evening. 
- A group of men is walking towards me. They are making weird noises and some of them have their shirts off. They are large, well built men. 
- They are literally swinging their arms and beating their chests.
- I ignore them.

## Interesting tweets

### @1frgvn

These are a selection of tweets from this period which relate to everything that has been happening. Most of them have been translated, a lot, so I assume the Spanish are reading them.

Many of these tweets are confirmation of what has been going on.

- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1707868906604417428
- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1707862141175230874 -> this was in reference to tables posted all over the Google search results of `@jctot19`. I didn't know what it was referring to at the time and could only guess. Now I think it is to do with being gang raped on a table by a bunch of men in 1989, and it was filmed, and I have no conscious awareness of that happening apart from some sketchy clues that I may have mentioned in my police interview and/or statement which they will have had access to.
- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1707832088605413497 -> attempts at being reasonable with psychopaths.

- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1698755956253888965 -> many people thought I was making it all up. Spanish feminists, in particular, thought I wasn't worth supporting. The following May in Madrid, one of them will tell me that they thought I was a domestic violence sufferer and, therefore, unpredictable! I kid you not.
