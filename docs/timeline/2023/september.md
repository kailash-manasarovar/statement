## Going public on Twitter

- There had been some suggestion something awful was going to happen to me on the 4th September at home in Spain, possibly that I would be arrested but I didn't know what for.
- I assumed it would be something to do with my angry tweets about Domingo from May that I had deleted.
- I assumed it would be something to do with my views on trans.
- I realized that there had been a girl who thought she was a boy at the conservatory and her name was Silvia.

## Arriving home

- When I got home, an account had followed me, **kaka**, with a profile message that said: "For an immature boy, bad companions play a much greater role than good teachers." 

![Admission of guilt](../../content/images/admission%20of%20guilt.png)

- You can see the full profile in the last pic in the [August twitter doc](../../content/tweets/august-2023-twitter.pdf).
- I suspect at that point someone got concerned about the ramifications of what had been happening and were concerned about whether I was going to go to the police.

## Problem with the car washer

- The caretaker at Carrer Furs, Pedro, informs me there is a leak in my car washing fluid. I see the blue fluid all over the floor in the garage where I park my car. I think it is to do with a small bump on the road in France.
- I tell Pedro about being bullied by the conservatory.
- He suggests I take the car to his friend who is a mechanic. The friend comes to check my car but doesn't see anything and tells me I have to bring it to the workshop.
- I don't want to leave my car with someone I don't know, and I don't know how I will travel there and back.
- Pedro tells me he will take me himself in his car.
- It all feels like a set up to get me alone with Pedro and I say no.
- Pedro is a bit pervy, you see.
- The leaks stops and/or is intermittent.
- The following June, my garage in North London fix a broken motor in the window washer function of my car and tell me there's no leak at all.
- I believe Pedro may be involved in adding narcotics to my car in some way, or knows about because if anyone tampered with my car in the garage, he would know.
- I wondered if they managed to add something to come through the air vents, or something I could touch on the door handles maybe.
- I believe any of the caretakers at Carrer Furs 15 will be able to tell the police how criminals have able to add poison and narcotics to the water of my apartment.
- I told Pedro that I had been filmed sexually and I would pay 500 euros for any recordings.
- He was fired soon after.

## The water pipes

- Pedro had always been really keen to tell me about the water pipes coming into the flat and the fact that they were broken.
- I had raised this with the landlady in July 2023 when I was going away for the summer but she ignored me.
- I raised it again in 2024. She ignored me again.
- On the day Pedro was fired, and showing the new caretaker around the apartments, he took pains to tell me that the water pipes were not only broken outside my door (see picture below) but also at the ground floor level where the mains water is distributed to all the flats in the building.
- He pointed out that every pipe was fine, except mine.
- And it's curious that at both places you can cut off the mains water into my apartment, it is impossible to do so.
- Basically, you cannot close off the water pipes to my flat. The water pipe outside the door is broken, and so is the one at the bottom of the building. They are broken in exactly the same way too. So there is no way to close off the water coming from the mains.
- I wonder if this is because, if you are poisoning someone, perhaps in a drip-feed type manner, and they can close off the pipes when they leave the building, then the poison, or narcotic, or whatever, could collect in large doses and kill someone instantaneously. 
- I wonder if that's happened before. I wonder if that's why there is a specific clause about me dying in the apartment in my tenancy agreement. Could the people of Denia be that evil?

- Even though the water pipe is closed off in the picture, it continues to run into my house.

## Men outside with handheld devices

- The following few days after I arrive home, I notice men outside on the street hanging around with handheld devices.
- I believe they are accessing my network somehow, using these devices.
- I am talking with my friend on my mobile phone through WhatsApp calls, a Tibetan monk. I'm explaining to him what's going on, and he suggests he comes to visit me.
- I say yes, please do come.
- At that moment, I lose control of my mobile phone completely. Every key I press, does something entirely different. The whole screen is scrambled.
- I turn off the router and get immediate control of my phone again.
- I believe now they wanted me to think that the hackers are external players when in reality access was gained directly from the router via Mac spoofing with information only known to either the telecommunications company, Telco, or the ISP itself, which at that time was Yoigo.

## People on the beach

- It's hot and I go to the beach every day in the afternoon.
- I'm followed up and down the beach every day by the same group of people that I begin to recognize each day.
- There is a couple, a woman and man, who I see every day milling around me. The man is bald and is wearing dog tags. He has his back to me usually and has his dog tags hanging behind on a chain.
- The woman is in her early 50s. I'd recognize her face again. One day I smiled at her and she got really scared, really quickly, and I knew.
- These two were at the piano concert at the Casa de Cultura on 8th March 2024.
- One afternoon, I'm walking back along the beach and there's a group of young men sitting on chairs. The couple I've just mentioned is with them.
- As I walk past, the young men start making sexual moaning noises and touching themselves on their chests.

## Smurf cat

- I go to the beach dressed pretty much like Smurf Cat, a meme that appears on my Jack Chardwood twitter account.
- https://x.com/JackChardwood/status/1704386000493887568.
- Of course, a play on words of my name.
- https://x.com/Smurfcatbsc
- Smurf cat's hat is like mine that I wear to the beach.

## My friend visits

- My friend the Tibetan monk visits for a few days in September.
- We are followed along the beach by a group of men who behave extremely strangely. I would remember them again, and I saw one of them in town and I saw two of the others in the laundry one day. 
- My friend will remember this as it was extremely odd.
- Coming back from Las Rotas, when we got off the bus, Ana the violin teacher "bumps" into us and she's extremely angry. I know it's another choreographed deceit and I know it's all intended for me to see and wonder about, get stressed about.
- They know exactly where I am at any given moment.
- This could only be the case if they had full access to my mobile phone including the location function.

## Alex and Paul

- I knock on Paul's door to say hello. He is surprised to see me. He's an old friend from Denia.
- He puts me and Alex in contact, another old friend from Denia.
- I meet Alex and tell her everything that's been happening. I must appear extremely stressed and anxious.
- Myself, Paul, and Alex meet for coffee soon after.
- I meet Alex a few times over the next months until March 8th and then I don't really hear from anyone again, apart from Paul who I continue to "bump" into at the Open Market where he's having a beer.
- We arrange to meet for Halloween as we had done in 2007.
- Every time I meet them, people turn up and sit right beside us and I know they're listening to everything we say.
- When I get back home and check Twitter, things we have said in our conversation are posted on fake accounts.

## Meeting Christine

- I meet Christine BJ for lunch and tell her everything that's been going on.
- I tell her I think the engineer who is hacking me is called David.
- I'm upset when she laughs at me in a jeering manner when I tell her that the teachers threw dirty water on me from an upstairs window.
- I realize there's really very few people I can trust, if anyone.

## Gypsy serenades through the tunnel

- Every time I walk through the tunnel, there is a gypsy busker playing music related to everything that has gone on with the trumpet teacher.
- One day, three gypsies stand at the end of the tunnel and the young girl sings loudly at me about a lucky frog and other stuff related to what's been going on.

## Year 4 professional piano begins

- I signed up and paid for the course in June, much to everyone's dismay no doubt.
    - [Application form](../../content/documents/papeles-conservatorio/KATHARINE%20MARGARET%20MURPHY%20-%20MATRICULA.pdf).
    - [Proof of payment](../../content/documents/papeles-conservatorio/KATHARINE%20MARGARET%20MURPHY%20-%20pago.pdf).

## Chamber music

- The conservatory classes begin again and I'm put with two singers.
- Katia is, apparently, a friend of Ana and she play acts being really angry with me throughout the course.
- I write to her eventually as she gives me her mobile phone number.

## Harmony classes

- We have a new teacher, Alfonso, for harmony.
- One afternoon I see him following me around Denia.
- Everyone knows what's been going on and has been invited to join in.
- I wonder what they've been told about me that would make them so eager to terrorize me, or whether it's just something they enjoy doing to random people from time to time.
- I now wonder if anyone knows about the sexual grooming and the danger to minors. I hope they don't but you never know.

## Piano classes

- Paqui Fornet Pastor is my new piano teacher and I really don't expect her to be involved in anything that has been going on.
- It turns out she's a ringleader and the [boat club episode](march.md#choir-rehearsal-at-the-boat-club) must have been a show-and-tell for hubby.

## Choir

- We have a new teacher for choir, Salva Tur.
- When I introduce myself as he's going around the class, he grins at me, "oh, you're Katharine", he says sheepishly.
- A little later he starts singing "it's too good to be true".
- That evening on Twitter, an account named Salva, posts a dick pic.
- I mention [dick pics on Twitter in January 2024](https://x.com/search?q=dick%20pic%20(from%3A1frgvn)&src=typed_query&f=live), right before choir class.
- About half an hour into the class, Salva's WhatsApp beeps and he looks at his messages.
- Suddenly, he's enraged and he makes a fool of himself by talking about terrible things that happen to people. 
- I'm appalled at his behavior in class. He says things that would make parents stop their children coming to his class if they knew.
- I also know someone had sent him my posts at that moment and, due to the guilt, he became uncontrollably enraged.

## Apes beating their chests

- I'm walking home with my Indian takeaway one evening. 
- A group of men is walking towards me. They are making weird noises and some of them have their shirts off. They are large, well built men. 
- They are literally swinging their arms and beating their chests.
- I ignore them.

## Interesting tweets

### @1frgvn

These are a selection of tweets from this period which relate to everything that has been happening. Most of them have been translated, a lot, so I assume the Spanish are reading them.

Many of these tweets are confirmation of what has been going on.

- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1707862141175230874 -> this was in reference to tables posted all over the Google search results of `@jctot19`. I didn't know what it was referring to at the time and could only guess. Now I think it is to do with being gang raped on a table by a bunch of men in 1989, and it was filmed, and I have no conscious awareness of that happening apart from some sketchy clues that I may have mentioned in my police interview and/or statement which they will have had access to.
- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1707832088605413497 -> attempts at being reasonable with psychopaths.

- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1698755956253888965 -> many people thought I was making it all up. Spanish feminists, in particular, thought I wasn't worth supporting. The following May in Madrid, one of them will tell me that they thought I was a domestic violence sufferer and, therefore, unpredictable! I kid you not.
