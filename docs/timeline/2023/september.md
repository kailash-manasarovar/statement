## Going public on Twitter

- There had been some suggestion something awful was going to happen to me on the 4th September at home in Spain, possibly that I would be arrested but I didn't know what for.
- The way this happened was exactly the same way I knew something threatening was going to happen on the 12th June, i.e. tweet manipulation.
- I innocently assumed it would be something to do with my angry tweets about Domingo from May that I had deleted, and related to my views on trans.
- I realized that there had been a girl who thought she was a boy at the conservatory and her name was indeed Silvia.

    - https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1697912956871217359
- From this moment onwards, the English language of the stalker accounts is usually native and vernacular. I'm convinced this is when Hazel and her associates stepped in. I have no idea Hazel and Sandra Smith have been involved in this story since 2006.
- The tweet that goes viral is here:

![viral tweet when asking for GC help](../../content/tweets/tweet-that-went-viral.png)

- At the time, I believe the wild interest on this tweet and the sudden 1000s of followers I gained were mostly genuine. I now believe that the majority of these accounts were fake accounts controlled by criminal gangs in UK and Spain.

### The cold shoulder from Spanish feminists

- Well known feminists reach out to me to see if they can help.
- I cannot be clear with them about what the Denia hackers are going to do because it is all suggestions from ramped up threats online.
- They decide unilaterally I'm lying and that I'm not to be trusted.
- One, in particular, upsets me enormously by telling me, "you're not being hacked", as if it's all in my mind or I'm lying. This was extraordinarily triggering.
- I realize that feminists are as misogynist as everyone else. I knew that anyway.
- Nevertheless, it was extremely upsetting and eyeopening.

## Arriving home

- When I get home, I see an account has followed me, **kaka**, with a profile message that said: "For an immature boy, bad companions play a much greater role than good teachers." 

![Admission of guilt](../../content/images/admission%20of%20guilt.png)

- You can see the full profile in the last pic in the [August twitter doc](../../content/tweets/august-2023-twitter.pdf).
- I suspect at that point someone got concerned about the ramifications of what had been happening and were concerned about whether I was going to go to the police.

## Rosa in town

- Whenever I walk into Denia, I see Rosa Vidal, Director of the Conservatory of Denia, who often nearly bumps into me but never says hello or acknowledges me.
- She's doing it on purpose.
- On one occasion she is sitting outside a shop I come out from next to a man resembling the trumpet teacher.
- It frightens me.

## Problem with the car washer

- The caretaker at Carrer Furs, Pedro, informs me there is a leak in my car washing fluid. I see the blue fluid all over the floor in the garage where I park my car. I think it is to do with a small bump on the road in France.
- He suggests I take the car to his friend who is a mechanic. I'm reluctant.
- I tell Pedro about being bullied by the conservatory.
- Instead, I take it to a garage in Javea who make me wait all day and do nothing at all, and charge me for it too.
- I realize I cannot take my car to any garage within about 100 miles radius, or more.
- Domingo's dad is in the car business and I wonder if I met him in 2012 when I had a flat battery when I lived in the Passeig Periodista Ramon Ortega.

## The water pipes

- Pedro had always been really keen to tell me about the water pipes coming into the flat and the fact that they were broken.
- I had raised this with the landlady in July 2023 when I was going away for the summer but she ignored me.
- I raised it again in 2024 on WhatsApp and sent her a picture. She said "perfecto".

![The broken water pipe outside my apartment](../../content/images/water-pipes.JPG)

- On the day Pedro was fired, and he was showing the new caretaker around the apartments, he took pains to tell me that the water pipes were not only broken outside my door (see picture below) but also at the ground floor level where the mains water is distributed to all the flats in the building.
- He pointed out that every pipe was fine, except mine. He was very insistent I knew about this. He hadn't been previously.
- It's curious that at *both* places you can cut off the mains water into my apartment, it is impossible to do so.
- Even though the water pipe is closed off in the picture, it continues to run into my house.
- Basically, you cannot close off the water pipes to my flat. The water pipe outside the door is broken, and so is the one at the bottom of the building. They are broken in exactly the same way too. So there is no way to close off the water coming from the mains.
- I wonder if this is because, if you are poisoning someone, perhaps in a drip-feed type manner, and they can close off the pipes when they leave the building, then the poison, or narcotic, or whatever, could collect in large doses and kill someone instantaneously. 
- I wonder if that's happened before. I wonder if that's why there is a specific clause about me dying in the apartment in my tenancy agreement. 
- Could the people of Denia be that evil?
- I believe any of the caretakers at Carrer Furs 13-15 will be able to tell the police how criminals have been able to add poison and narcotics to the water running into my apartment.

## Men outside with handheld devices

- The following few days after I arrive home, I notice men outside on the street hanging around with handheld devices.
- I believe they are accessing my network somehow, using these devices.
- I am talking with my friend on my mobile phone through WhatsApp calls, a Tibetan monk. I'm explaining to him what's going on, and he suggests he comes to visit me.
- I say yes, please do come.
- At that moment, I lose control of my mobile phone completely. Every key I press, does something entirely different. The whole screen is scrambled.
- I turn off the router and get immediate control of my phone again.
- I believe now they wanted me to think that the hackers are external players when in reality access was gained directly from the router via Mac spoofing with information only known to either the telecommunications company, Telco, or the ISP itself, which at that time was Yoigo.

## People on the beach

- It's hot and I go to the beach every day in the afternoon.
- I'm followed up and down the beach every day by the same group of people that I begin to recognize each day.
- There is a couple, a woman and man, who I see every day milling around me. The man is balding and is wearing dog tags. He has his back to me usually and has his dog tags hanging down the back of his neck on a chain.
- The woman is in her early 50s. I'd recognize her face again. One day I smiled at her and she got really scared, really quickly, and I knew.
- These two were at the [piano concert](../2024/march.md#tuesday-12th-march) at the Casa de Cultura on 12th March 2024.
- One afternoon, I'm walking back along the beach and there's a group of young men sitting on chairs. The couple I've just mentioned is with them.
- As I walk past, the young men start making sexual moaning noises and touching themselves on their chests.

### The man in the Alhambra pic

- A couple of time while I'm stalked up and down the beach at Las Marinas this month I see the very same man from the [July pics](july.md#the-guy-at-the-alhambra) with a woman.

## Smurf cat

- I go to the beach dressed pretty much like Smurf Cat, a meme that appears on my Jack Chardwood twitter account.
- https://x.com/JackChardwood/status/1704386000493887568.
- Of course, a play on words of my name.
- https://x.com/Smurfcatbsc is a copy of the original.
- Smurf cat's hat is like mine that I wear to the beach.

![Smurf cat's hat](../../content/images/smurf-cat-hat.png)

## A handyman comes to fix a minor thing in the bathroom

- At some point this month, the air extractor thing pops out of the ceiling in the bathroom.
- I believe now they have come in and done this so I will call Beatrice for a handyman to fix it, which I do.
- A man called Fabio comes to fix it, a handyman +34-727-70-53-89. It is an extremely minor thing that should take 5 minutes.
- He goes into the bathroom and closes the door. He is in there for 30 minutes or so with the door closed.
- I now wonder if he was sent to do something else entirely.
- At the same time, I have to change my driving license to a Spanish one and there is a huge confusion with Northern Ireland and I'm very stressed because no-one is able to help me.
- However, I'm excessively stressed, likely because of what is going on in Denia, and also because of being drugged somehow, I believe.
- I'm on the phone to someone who is behaving in a particularly unhelpful way at the moment Pablo comes out of the bathroom.
- I'm clearly very stressed and upset.
- He barks at me, "You're sick!".
- It was extremely rude and a very unusual thing to say and I had no idea why he would say such a thing.
- I now believe he knew I was being poisoned and drugged, and was telling me so.
- It was clear he despised me for some reason.
- I saw him around the urbanization from time to time. I now wonder if other flats are being used for similar purposes as mine is.

## Stones thrown at me

- One Saturday I go hiking on the mountain.
- As I'm walking through the town towards the mountain, a car full of young men drives past me.
- I'm hit by stones thrown at me from the car.

## My friend visits

- My friend the Tibetan monk visits for a few days in September.
- He came at my request when I was being terrorized online and I was very scared and stressed.
- We had a marvelous few days together.
- However, one afternoon we are followed along the beach by a group of men who behave extremely strangely. I would remember them again, and I saw one of them in town and I saw two of the others in the laundry one day. 
- One man, bald, 50s, was sitting on a chair close to the water.
- Another man, younger, 40s, dark, fat, wearing khakis and a white vest was roaming around, and he even came right up to where we were sitting and lingered around us close.
- The bald man started to shout at him to move away. He didn't. He was furiously typing on his mobile phone.
- My friend will remember all this as it was extremely odd.
- I stood up to protect our spot somehow and I saw a man walking down the beach towards the town who looked like the trumpet teacher (but wasn't probably, just the same build, too young again).
- On another occasion we became embroiled in choreographed intrigue involving teachers from the conservatory.
- Coming back from Las Rotas, when we got off the bus, Ana the violin teacher "bumps" into us. She's extremely angry. I know it's another choreographed deceit and I know it's all intended for me to see and wonder about, and get stressed about.
- She's timed to meet us at exactly the right moment, and we have been constantly moving through the town and on public transport.
- They knew exactly where I am at any given moment.
- This could only be the case if they had full access to my mobile phone including the location function.
- We see Paqui Fornet too one afternoon. I say "hi" and she ignores me.
- During this time, there is much content related to "pandas" on my account and this, and consequent messages, leads me to believe that this is how they are referring to my Tibetan friend.

## Alex and Paul

- I knock on Paul's door to say hello. He is surprised to see me. He's an old friend from Denia.
- He puts me and Alex (Alessandra) in contact, another old friend from Denia.
- I meet Alex and tell her everything that's been happening. I must appear extremely stressed and anxious.
- Myself, Paul, and Alex meet for coffee soon after.
- Paul tells me rather private things that I suspect the stalkers are hoping I'll tweet about.
- I meet Alex a few times over the next months until around March 12th and then I don't really hear from anyone again, apart from Paul who I continue to "bump" into at the Open Market where he's having a beer from time to time.
- These meetings are obviously pre-arranged by others in order to get information from me.
- We arrange to meet for Halloween as we had done in 2007.
- Every time I meet them, people turn up immediately and sit right beside us. I know they're listening to everything we say.
- I now remember that one of these people was likely [the man with Ana on the Montgo in May](../2024/may.md#climbing-the-montgo).
- When I get back home and check Twitter, things the three of us have said in our conversation are posted on fake account profiles.
- This happens with anyone I talk to.

!!! tip "Background"
    - A previously fit and strong woman, around 2008 or 2009, Alex suddenly became unwell with a weird autoimmune thing I can't remember.
    - We weren't socializing at that time but I remember bumping into her and she was extremely anxious and worried about it.
    - She underwent a harsh surgery where she had a full bone marrow transplant around 2009/10 or thereabouts.
    - She survived the surgery but her health was severely affected by it.
    - She was apparently the first person in Spain to have undergone such surgery and the surgeon was a very important and significant man in his field.

## Meeting Christine

- I meet Christine BJ for lunch and tell her everything that's been going on.
- I tell her I think the engineer who is hacking me is called David.
- I'm upset when she laughs at me in a jeering manner when I tell her that the teachers threw dirty water on me from an upstairs window.
- She's really quite blase about it all and rather dismissive. This continues to be her stance as the terror progresses.
- I realize there's really very few people I can trust, if anyone.

## Gypsy serenades through the tunnel

- Every time I walk through the tunnel, there is a gypsy busker playing music related to everything that has gone on with the trumpet teacher.
- One day, three gypsies stand at the end of the tunnel and the young woman sings loudly at me about a lucky frog in a box, and other stuff related to what's been going on.
- I recognize the young woman from an account that followed me on Twitter `@JackChardwood` over the summer when the hacking and stalking was intensifying. The account had a name that included "Suarez".
- This is a more recent fake account with her picture in:

![Gypsy singer](../../content/images/fake-accounts/townsfolk_1.png)

## Year 4 professional piano begins

- I signed up and paid for the course in June, much to everyone's dismay no doubt.
    - [Application form](../../content/documents/papeles-conservatorio/KATHARINE%20MARGARET%20MURPHY%20-%20MATRICULA.pdf).
    - [Proof of payment](../../content/documents/papeles-conservatorio/KATHARINE%20MARGARET%20MURPHY%20-%20pago.pdf).

## Chamber music

- The conservatory chamber music classes begin again and I'm to accompany two singers.
- Katia is, apparently, a friend of Ana and she play acts being really angry with me throughout the course.
- I write to her eventually after she gives me her mobile phone number in December.

## Harmony classes

- We have a new teacher, Alfonso, for harmony.
- One afternoon I see him following me around Denia.
- It's clear that everyone knows what's been going on and has been invited to join in terrorizing the female target of the moment.
- I wear a funny t-shirt to class in an attempt to make light of it all and carry on with my studies.

![Don't poke the bear](../../content/images/dont-poke-the-bear.png)

- I don't realize at this time that the gang stalkers, Domingo and his accomplices, intend nothing less than my total destruction.
- I wonder what they've been told about me that would make them so eager to terrorize me, or whether it's just something they enjoy doing to random people (women and girls) from time to time.
- I now wonder if they were always aware of the sexual grooming and the danger to minors.

## Piano classes

- Paqui Fornet Pastor is my new piano teacher and I really don't expect her to be involved in anything that has been going on.
- It turns out she's a ringleader and the [boat club episode](march.md#choir-rehearsal-at-the-boat-club) must have been a show-and-tell for hubby.

## Choir

- We have a new teacher for choir, Salva Tur, an unpleasant man who thought we would like to hear him talking for 1 hour and 50 minutes of each class and then do 10 minutes of singing. 
- The choir course, aside from the bullying, was excruciatingly boring.
- When I introduce myself as he's going around the class, he grins at me in a knowing way, "oh, you're Katharine".
- A little later he starts singing "it's too good to be true".
- That evening on Twitter, an account named Salva, posts a dick pic.
- I mention [dick pics on Twitter in January 2024](../2024/january.md#dick-pics-from-the-choir-master), right before choir class.

## Apes beating their chests

- I'm walking home with my Indian takeaway one evening. 
- A group of men is walking towards me. They are making weird noises and some of them have their shirts off. They are large, well built men. 
- They are literally swinging their arms and beating their chests.
- I ignore them.

## Interesting tweets

### @1frgvn

These are a selection of tweets from this period which relate to everything that has been happening. Most of them have been translated, a lot, so I assume the Spanish are reading them.

Many of these tweets are confirmation of what has been going on.

- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1707868906604417428
- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1707862141175230874 -> this was in reference to tables posted all over the Google search results of `@jctot19`. I didn't know what it was referring to at the time and could only guess. Now I think it is to do with being gang raped on a table by a bunch of men in 1989, and it was filmed, and I have no conscious awareness of that happening apart from some sketchy clues that I may have mentioned in my police interview and/or statement which they will have had access to.
- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1707832088605413497 -> attempts at being reasonable with psychopaths.

- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1698755956253888965 -> many people thought I was making it all up. Spanish feminists, in particular, thought I wasn't worth supporting. The following May in Madrid, one of them will tell me that they thought I was a domestic violence sufferer and, therefore, unpredictable! I kid you not.
