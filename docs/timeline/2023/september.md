## Going public on Twitter

- There had been some suggestion something awful was going to happen to me on the 4th September at home in Spain, possibly that I would be arrested but I didn't know what for.
- I assumed it would be something to do with my angry tweets about Domingo from May that I had deleted.
- I assumed it would be something to do with my views on trans.
- I realized that there had been a girl who thought she was a boy at the conservatory and her name was Silvia.

## Arriving home

- When I got home, an account had followed me, **kaka**, with a profile message that said: "For an immature boy, bad companions play a much greater role than good teachers."

- You can see the full profile in the last pic in the [August twitter doc](../../content/tweets/august-2023-twitter.pdf).
- I suspect at that point someone got concerned about the ramifications of what had been happening and were concerned about whether I was going to go to the police.

## Problem with the car washer

- The caretaker, Pedro, informs me there is a leak in my car washing fluid. You can see it all over the floor in the garage where I park my car. I think it is to do with a small bump on the road in France.
- I tell Pedro about being bullied by the conservatory.
- He suggests I take the car to his friend who is a mechanic, the friend comes to check my car but doesn't see anything and tells me I have to bring it to the workshop.
- I don't really want to leave my car with someone I don't know, and I don't know how I will travel there and back.
- Pedro tells me he will take me himself in his car.
- It all feels like a set up to get me alone with Pedro and I say no.
- Pedro is a bit pervy, you see.
- The leaks stops and/or is intermittent.
- The following June my garage in North London fix a broken motor in the window washer function of my car and tell me there's no leak at all.
- I believe Pedro may be involved in adding narcotics to my car in some way, perhaps through the air vents, or maybe on the door handles.
- I told Pedro that I had been filmed sexually and I would pay 500 euros for any recordings.
- He was fired soon after.
