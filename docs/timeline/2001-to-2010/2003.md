## Porn fatwa

### Or, the perfect victim

- Sometime in or around 2003, a porn fatwa was issued on my head.
- Undoubtedly this has happened to numerous people for various reasons over the years.
- In my case, North London criminal gangs responsible for distributing pornography in which I had repeatedly "starred" as a sedated child, gang raped by numerous black men in Tottenham, were watching closely as it became clear I was going to suddenly have a lot of extra cash from the Lockerbie air disaster compensation payouts; £250k to be precise.
- This was a figure criminal honey-trapping porn-gangs could not ignore, obviously.
- The fatwa, as it were, I believe to have been a notification on men's underground porn-addict community networks requesting DIY spy-cam and/or sedated porn, of me, so that they might target me and blackmail me for my money.
- At the same time, the early films will have been re-released so as I would be recognized and to whet the appetite.
- I'm guessing substantial rewards would have been on offer for any porn with me in it, or maybe they gamified the whole thing online.
- Therefore, every single relationship, and indeed every job I have had since 2003 is potentially part of the wider conspiracy.
- I expect I have starred sedated or otherwise in countless more spy-cam porn videos since then.
- It is my belief this *fatwa* became uncontrollable and its spidery-tentacles extended into my professional life, my personal life, everywhere.
- I believe criminal gangs of porn creators and distributors, a global tech-bro audience, and porn addicts the world over have been watching in horror as I pick up the multiple threads and untangle them one-after-the-other, never having thought for a second they'd get found out.

- Also, I'm sure [my friend with the facial disfigurement](../2024/august.md#ugly) can shed more light on this as he may have been [the one to get it started](2001.md#amsterdam) and also the [one to finish it](../2024/august.md#distract-and-drug-activity), just before the porn-gangs of Dénia tried to finish me off, hoping for the [end of an era maybe](../2024/october.md#serious-poisoning-with-intent-to-harm-or-kill).
- They got a lot more than they bargained for.
- So, apart from the relationships already detailed in this police statement, it's probably worth mentioning another few.

### Dennis Buchwald 2003

- A Dutch porn addict living in Rotterdam I met in Australia in early 2003, the first year I received a wedge, who love bombed me and paid for a flight for me to visit him in Hong Kong for two weeks.
- I believe he made porn of me while I was there.
- Dennis was a computer programmer working for a major tech company: Concentrix.
- The firm was running a multi-billion dollar tech systems operation based in Hong Kong. The team was made up of mainly Dutch men and the lead was a cowboy with long hair, cowboy boots, and a cigarette.
- I believe it is highly likely the team he worked with, that I met for dinner one evening in Hong Kong, knew what he was up to with me.
- Was this the first tech-bro firm involved in the North London and Spanish porn-gang sedated-sex-slave conspiracy?
- The last time I looked him up, about 10 years ago, his Facebook profile had a picture of him and two women posing as ISIS terrorists which I found extremely odd and then promptly thought no more about it.
- He was the first man (since Winston May the pedophile in 1989) who spoke to me in an overtly affected and disingenuous manner, as if he proper thought I was an idiot.
- He told me, by text while I was in Australia after two days of knowing him, that he had decided he was calling me *Pookie*. Online stalkers on X call me *Pookie*, a lot.
- He had a Greek "girlfriend" on the tour when I met him; a woman who looked after stray dogs in Athens. And one of the other women on the tour, a Canadian, he flew out to visit him in Hong Kong once I had left!
- Did he create more porn with them and others without their knowledge?

### Adrian 2007

- Adrian was a friend of Anita Diamond.
- She and her husband Matthew introduced us and set me up with him.
- They were very keen on getting me into a relationship for some reason, and had been instrumental in the [disastrous Dave Porter affair](../early-years/2006.md#guardian-soulmates).
- Adrian was introduced not long afterwards.
- I met Adrian in Valencia and we stayed in a hotel one night and had sex.
- I told him I'd just remembered being gang raped as a child, and was traumatized by that, and for that reason I was not interested in taking it further.
- I don't really know why I had sex with him, but he was a nice enough guy.
- Looking back, I believe near-constant PTSD was causing my behavior to be erratic and self-destructive.
- I was also extremely easily manipulated by "friends" and I had known Anita since I was 11, a near-perfect conspirator.
- I wonder if the brief and unloving encounter with Adrian begat another porn video.
- If so, there would have been a lot of people involved in conspiring to organize it, and the hotel room would have to have been set up with spy cams.
- He also had a Blackberry and a beeper.
- Adrian had links to criminal gangs; Anita took pains to tell me this more than once when [we worked together at Qredo in 2021](../2021/march.md#qredo).
- I think he told me he'd been a doorman too. 
- I'd be delighted to be wrong about Adrian but in my current statelessness, homelessness, joblessness, utter lack of human rights and no-one taking any notice of what's happened to me and so many more women and children in Spain, I have no option but to add anything that might be part of the most sinister global sedated-sex-slave porn conspiracy that probably most men are aware of, and don't think there's a problem with for some reason.
- Do the porn-gangs of Dénia only target women and children they're 100% sure will never get help; the perfect victims?
- Adrian had children and his first grandchild had just been born when I met him; so I hope he will understand why I had to include him.
