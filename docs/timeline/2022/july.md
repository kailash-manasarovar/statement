- I set off for trips/stays in UK and France for the whole summer
- Google maps starts sending me on bizarre journeys which include going down dirt tracks and I'm unable to see why

    - It already appears that the hackers had already breached my mobile phone and were tracking my movements and changing the Google maps settings.
    - It is highly likely that I was hacked from the moment the Yoigo router was set up in my house.
    - It is also likely that I was hacked and monitored continually by criminal gangs in DÃ©nia since 2014.
