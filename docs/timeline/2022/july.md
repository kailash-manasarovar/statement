## Summer

- I set off to spend the whole summer in UK and France.
- Google maps starts sending me on bizarre journeys which include going down dirt tracks and I'm unable to see how to fix this in settings.

!!! important
    - It already appears that the hackers had already breached my mobile phone and were tracking my movements and changing the Google maps settings.
    - It is highly likely that I was seriously hacked from the moment the Yoigo router was set up in my house, February 2022.
    - It is also likely that I was hacked and monitored continually by criminal gangs in DÃ©nia since 2014.
    
## Other events

- There are a couple of interesting events that occur over the summer which are very much related to the story, but are totally unrelated to criminal matters. Therefore, I will placeholder them here and return to detail them when this statement turns into a novel with all the names changed.

### Jet in Lindisfarne

### Crystal dreaming in Glastonbury
