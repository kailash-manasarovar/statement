    - It already appears that the hackers had already breached my mobile phone and were tracking my movements and changing the Google maps settings.
    - It is highly likely that I was seriously hacked from the moment the Yoigo router was set up in my house, February 2022.
    - It is also likely that I was hacked and monitored continually by criminal gangs in DÃ©nia since 2014.
