## Chamber music classes

- Vidal flirted with me at the music classes.
- I fancied him.
- I hadn't liked a man since 2003, and I was still depressed, so it was all a bit unsettling.
- I also felt it was all a set up and Domingo was behind it, for revenge.
- I know that this "pretending to like you game" is what Spanish men do to women who "turn them down" and it had bizarrely happened to me before so I knew what was going on.
- However, tt was impossible to know how to deal with it.
- At some point I looked the trumpet teacher up online and found his Facebook page.
- There was a picture of him, with two young girls, who looked embarrassed to be there. 
- There were some messages from people on his Facebook saying "look how much they've grown" so I assumed they were his daughters
- I heard him tell my classmate Pablo, and when I asked him later, he also told me he was a secondary school teacher teaching music in Valencia.
- When I looked at his Facebook page again over Christmas it appeared that he had deleted it.
- The Facebook name was exactly the same as the name in the GV systems, Vidal Sastre Sanchez Hornero (VSSH).
- I started to think about him a lot. I have a tendency to do this with men I like so there was nothing strange about it from my side. 
- It was a bit irritating though, and I knew there was a "plot" against me with regards to all this, so it was a bit stressful too.

## Feeling unwell at home

- I felt unwell a lot at home, disordered and nauseated at times.
- I often drink wine at the weekend, not much, a couple of glasses usually.
- However, I often became extremely unwell after drinking two glasses of red wine and this was quite strange.
- It was as if I didn't have the capacity to handle the alcohol for some reason.
- Also, I was feeling disordered and clumsy. I cut myself quite badly in the kitchen at some point over the Autumn.
