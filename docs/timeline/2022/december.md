## Chamber music classes

- The trumpet teacher was flirting with me at the music classes.
- I fancied him.
- I hadn't liked a man like that since 2003, and I was still depressed, so it was all a bit unsettling.
- I also felt it was all a set up and Domingo was behind it, for revenge.
- I know that this "pretending to like you game" is what Spanish men do to women who "turn them down" and it had bizarrely happened to me before so I knew what was going on.
- However, it was impossible to know how to deal with it.
- I felt I was in a situation I could do nothing about at that time, except see what happened.
- At some point I looked the trumpet teacher up online and found his Facebook page.
- There was a picture of him, with two young girls. They all looked embarrassed to be there. 
- There were some messages from people on his Facebook saying "look how much they've grown" so I assumed they were his daughters
- I heard him tell my classmate Pablo - and when I asked him later he also told me - he was a secondary school teacher teaching music in the outskirts of Valencia, some 8kms away from the center of the city. I can't remember the name of the town he said, but it began with B.
- I found no record of him teaching at any secondary school online.
- When I looked at his Facebook page again over Christmas it appeared that he had deleted it, or blocked me, I'm not familiar with how Facebook works.
- The Facebook name was exactly the same as the name in the GV systems, **Vidal Sastre Sanchez Hornero*.
- I started to think about him a lot. I have a tendency to do this with men I like so there was nothing strange about it from my side. 
- It was a bit irritating though, and I knew there was a "plot" against me with regards to all this, so it was a bit stressful too.

## Choir concert

- There was a Christmas choir concert for the whole conservatory and it took place in the hall at the [Balearic Port](http://www.baleariaport.com/en/nuestros-servicios/espacios-socioculturales/).
- I was feeling nervous and anxious a lot around this time. I didn't relate it to anything untoward.
- At the concert, there was a moment where I saw the trumpet teacher (with his back to me) sitting in the front row watching the students of the orchestra play. I did not see his face but it seemed to be him.
- To my left, I caught Domingo's eye. He was looking at me.
- I knew the whole thing was a set up from that moment.

## Feeling unwell at home

- I felt unwell a lot at home, disordered and nauseated at times.
- I often drink wine at the weekend, not much, a couple of glasses usually.
- However, I often became extremely unwell after drinking just two glasses of red wine and this was quite strange.
- It was as if I didn't have the capacity to handle the alcohol for some reason.
- Also, I was feeling disordered and clumsy. I cut myself quite badly in the kitchen at some point over the Autumn and was rather traumatized by the incident, which was also strange.

## Dreams and premonitions

- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1602792091238678528
- I dreamt of the trumpet teacher and Russian dolls around this time. 
- I also dreamt the trumpet teacher had an evil brother who was like a devil.
- These things are to be included in the novel and can be ignored by investigators.

## A seizure in Thailand

- Something I didn't think to include previously but I probably should is the fact that while on holiday in Thailand over Christmas, I have some kind of seizure and end up at the emergency ward of Bangkok Hospital in Samui where my records remain.
