## Chamber music classes

- Vidal flirted with me at the music classes
- I felt like I fancied him
- I hadn't liked a man since 2003, and I was still depressed, so it was all a bit unsettling
- I knew it was a set up and Domingo was behind it
- I know that this is what Spanish men do to women who "turn them down" and it had bizarrely happened to me before
- It was impossible to know how to deal with all this
- At some point I looked him up and found his Facebook page
- There was a picture of him on it with two young girls who looked embarassed to be there
- There were some messages from people on his Facebook saying "look how much they've grown" so I assumed they were his daughters
- I heard him tell my classmate, and when I asked him later, he also told me he was a secondary school teacher teaching music in Valencia
- When I looked at his Facebook again over Christmas he had deleted it
- The Facebook name was exactly the same as the name in the GV systems, Vidal Sastre Sanchez Hornero (VSSH)
- I started to think about him a lot. I have a tendency to do this with men I like so there was nothing strange about it from my side. It was a bit irritating, and I knew there was a "plot" against me, so it was a bit stressful too

## Feeling unwell at home

- I feel unwell at home, disordered and nauseas at times
- I often drink wine at the weekend, not much, a couple of glasses usually
- I am often extremely unwell after drinking two glasses of red wine which is quite strange
- I am disordered and clumsy. I cut myself quite badly in the kitchen
