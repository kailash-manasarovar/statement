## Chamber music classes

- The trumpet teacher was flirting with me at the music classes.
- I fancied him.
- I hadn't liked a man like that since 2003, and I was still depressed, so it was all a bit unsettling.
- I also felt it was all a set up and Domingo was behind it, for revenge.
- I know that this "pretending to like you game" is what Spanish men do to women who "turn them down" and it had bizarrely happened to me before so I knew what was going on.
- However, it was impossible to know how to deal with it.
- I felt I was in a situation I could do nothing about at that time, except see what happened.
- At some point I looked the trumpet teacher up online and found his Facebook page.
- There was a picture of him, with two young girls. They all looked embarrassed to be there. 
- There were some messages from people on his Facebook saying "look how much they've grown" so I assumed they were his daughters
- I heard him tell my classmate Pablo - and when I asked him later he also told me - he was a secondary school teacher teaching music in the outskirts of Valencia, some 8kms away from the center of the city. I can't remember the name of the town he said, but it began with B.
- I found no record of him teaching at any secondary school online.
- When I looked at his Facebook page again over Christmas it appeared that he had deleted it, or blocked me, I'm not familiar with how Facebook works.
- The Facebook name was exactly the same as the name in the GV systems, **Vidal Sastre Sanchez Hornero*.
- I started to think about him a lot. I have a tendency to do this with men I like so there was nothing strange about it from my side. 
- It was a bit irritating though, and I knew there was a "plot" against me with regards to all this, so it was a bit stressful too.

## Dreaming of snakes

- I started having strange dreams around this time, after I had encountered the trumpet teacher.
- I usually tweeted about these dreams.
- I dreamt often of snakes.

## Choir concert

- There was a Christmas choir concert for the whole conservatory and it took place in the hall at the [Balearic Port](http://www.baleariaport.com/en/nuestros-servicios/espacios-socioculturales/).
- I was feeling nervous and anxious a lot around this time. I didn't relate it to anything untoward.
- At the concert, there was a moment where I saw the trumpet teacher (with his back to me) sitting in the front row watching the students of the orchestra play. I did not see his face but it seemed to be him.
- To my left, I caught Domingo's eye. He was looking at me.
- I knew the whole thing was a set up from that moment.
- I think it's likely they wanted me to know because I could not know the full extent of the attack against me, and wouldn't for nearly three years more.



## Feeling unwell at home

- I felt unwell a lot at home, disordered and nauseated at times.
- I often drink wine at the weekend, not much, a couple of glasses usually.
- However, I often became extremely unwell after drinking just two glasses of red wine and this was quite strange.
- It was as if I didn't have the capacity to handle the alcohol for some reason.
- Also, I was feeling disordered and clumsy. I cut myself quite badly in the kitchen at some point over the Autumn and was rather traumatized by the incident, which was also strange.

## Dreams and premonitions

- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1602792091238678528
- I dreamt of the trumpet teacher and Russian dolls around this time. 
- I also dreamt the trumpet teacher had an evil brother who was like a devil.
- These things are to be included in the novel and can be ignored by investigators.

## A seizure in Thailand

- Online and in-person bullying by criminal gangs, and teachers and staff at the conservatory of Dénia included using my own words and experiences that I had described in detail in my [2015 police statement I sent via email to the Metropolitan Police](../early-years/2015.md#statement-to-the-metropolitan-police) and repeating and replaying them back to me in order to cause me enormous distress and psychological injury.
- I did not know this was happening at this time. Indeed, it has only become clear to me in early 2025 after leaving Dénia and washing or throwing away most of my belongings which the criminals had doused in pesticides while I was away from my apartment, probably in mid-October 2024.
- In any case, constant triggering and reminders of my experience of being sexually abused by a North London rape-gang when I was a child was the backdrop to my psychological and emotional state while I was on holiday in Thailand over Christmas 2022.
- 

- Something I didn't think to include previously but I probably should is the fact that while on holiday in Thailand over Christmas, I have some kind of seizure and end up at the emergency ward of Bangkok Hospital in Samui where my records remain.
