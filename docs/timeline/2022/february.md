## Moving back to Dénia

- I move to my new flat in Dénia: Carrer Furs 15, B1 Escalera 2 Piso 3 Apartamento 17, Dénia 03700 Alicante Spain.

## My life

- I'm working online. I work a lot.
- I am on Twitter constantly.
- I do yoga 3 times a week online in my flat.
- I go walking with the English ladies every Saturday in the local area.
- I might take a walk on my own along the beach or Las Rotas from time to time.
- I go shopping for food.
- Apart from this, I have no social life, I see no one, I'm very isolated.

!!! info "Even more isolated today"
    - This remains the case even today when I am in Dénia. 
    - Even more so as I am afraid to go out as I am usually followed and terrorized in some manner by local people who always seem to know exactly where I am and where I'm going to be.
