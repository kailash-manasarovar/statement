## Classes start

- I start at the conservatory

!!! important
    - It's essential for the reader to realize that the teachers and staff had been planning an exaggerated gang stalking situation with me as target and, although I was aware that something evil was going on, I was completely unaware of the extent of it and how many people were involved until March 2024, nearly 18 months away.
    - Therefore, everything I describe with regards to the actions and behavior of the staff and teachers at the conservatory of Dénia is part of a carefully choreographed deceit and directed by Domingo Cano Lopez and his associate who was calling himself Vidal Sastre Sanchez Hornero.
    - It is not clear whether the staff and teachers at the conservatory were aware of the full implications of what was happening and whether they just assumed it was another woman being bullied like usual.
    - The question is, did they, and people like Trish Penny and Christine Betterton Jones know about the underlying plot running parallel which was sexual grooming, medicating/spiking, porn gathered from cyber-stalking/hacking/voyeurism, and potentially far worse.
    - Given that everyone knew I had been suicidally depressed, one must assume that an attack like this would have as it's main intention the suicide of the victim.

### Piano

- My teacher is Maria Hontanilla
- Mercedes Correas Lara is her student also. This doesn't make sense because Mercedes was in year 1 2015-16, which means she should have finished her studies two years previously but apparently it's ok
- It's even more curious given that Mercedes has clearly done no practice in 10 years
- Whenever I go to class, Maria teaches sometimes 20/30 minutes into my class time. Then Mercedes spends 10/15/20 minutes talking. Sometimes I'm left with 10 minutes of class. This is a weekly occurence. I'm unable to stay later as I'm working and my hours aren't so flexible

### Harmony

- The teacher is Adrian ..
- One of my classmates is Samuel who has near perfect English
- He is Domingo's student
- He was studying singing in Javea but moved to do piano in Dénia instead, it's not clear why
- Elvira is also in this class. She is Domingo's student also

### Choir

- The teacher is Concha 
- I have known Concha for years, since 2014
- I sold her a guitar and she used to come to the international choir from time to time
- Elvira and her sister ... both Domingo's students are in the choir class
- The sister bullies Concha. It's very embarassing.

### Chamber music

- This class is where I accompany a soloist
- My soloist is a trumpet student ..
- There is no teacher assigned to this class

## Domingo's little group

- Ocassionally I see Domingo around. He's always with his little group of youngsters and Samuel who's in his 20s
