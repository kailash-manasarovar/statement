## Classes start

- I start at the conservatory

### Piano

- My teacher is Maria Hontanilla
- Mercedes Correas Lara is her student also. This doesn't make sense because Mercedes was in year 1 2015-16, which means she should have finished her studies two years previously but apparently it's ok
- It's even more curious given that Mercedes has clearly done no practice in 10 years
- Whenever I go to class, Maria teaches sometimes 20/30 minutes into my class time. Then Mercedes spends 10/15/20 minutes talking. Sometimes I'm left with 10 minutes of class. This is a weekly occurence. I'm unable to stay later as I'm working and my hours aren't so flexible

### Harmony

- The teacher is Adrian ..
- One of my classmates is Samuel who has near perfect English
- He is Domingo's student
- He was studying singing in Javea but moved to do piano in DÃ©nia instead, it's not clear why
- Elvira is also in this class. She is Domingo's student also

### Choir

- The teacher is Concha 
- I have known Concha for years, since 2014
- I sold her a guitar and she used to come to the international choir from time to time
- Elvira and her sister ... both Domingo's students are in the choir class
- The sister bullies Concha. It's very embarassing.

### Chamber music

- This class is where I accompany a soloist
- My soloist is a trumpet student ..
- There is no teacher assigned to this class

## Domingo's little group

- Ocassionally I see Domingo around. He's always with his little group of youngsters and Samuel who's in his 20s
