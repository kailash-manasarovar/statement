## Conservatory open day

- After one Saturday walking with the English ladies, including Christine Betterton Jones and Patricia Penny, where we were talking about music and my piano studies, I look up the conservatory website to find there's an open day for new students.
- I go along and meet Joan Carles Poquet and Paqui Fornet Pastor.
- They seem angry with me. They give me angry looks and are brusque with me.
- Even so, I apply and prepare for the exam.

!!! note "About me"
    - I love playing the piano; it's an absolute joy, and people's ridiculous attitudes cannot stop me.
    - I don't care if people don't like me. 
    - I don't expect people to try to murder me just because they don't like me. Especially when they are civil servants working in a government public school setting, and taking care of hundreds of children. That would be insane, wouldn't it?

## Upstairs neighbor at Carrer Furs

- I occasionally bump into a man in the lift in my building who grins at me.
- He lives on one of the floors above me on my stairwell.
- Sometimes he is with, what I assume to be, his teenage daughter.
- He always grins at me in a sort of flirtatious way.
- I now believe he was involved from the start and perhaps was already watching me. His grin, therefore, was more sinister.
- Is it possible this man was involved in poisoning or drugging the mains water that goes to my house, and/or managing a LAN network of hidden cameras? Or does he perhaps know who is involved in this?
- It seems reasonable to assume that everyone knows.

!!! info
    - More recently, October 2024, I bumped into him again in the building's garden and he was unable to look me in the eye and seemed embarrassed.
