## Conservatory open day

- After one Saturday walking where we were talking about music, I look up the conservatory website to find there's an open day for new students 
- I go along and meet Joan Carles Poquet and Paqui Fornet Pastor
- They seem angry with me and give me angry looks and are brusque with me
- Even so, I prepare my exam
- I love playing the piano, it's an absolute joy, and people's ridiculous attitudes cannot stop me
- I don't care if I'm unliked
