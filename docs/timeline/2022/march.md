## Conservatory open day

- It's a Saturday afternoon after walking with the English ladies.
- We spoke a lot about music and my piano studies.
- I check the conservatory website when I get home and find there's an open day for new students.
- I go to the open day at the conservatory and meet Joan Carles Poquet and Paqui Fornet Pastor.
- They seem angry with me. They give me dirty looks and are brusque with me.
- Even so, I apply for year 3 of professional piano studies and start preparing for the exam.

!!! note "I love playing the piano"
    - It's an absolute joy and people's ridiculous attitudes cannot stop me.
    - I don't care if people don't like me. Most people don't.
    - I don't expect people to try to murder me (or anyone else) just because they don't like me, however. Especially when they are civil servants working in a government-funded school setting, and taking care of hundreds of children. 
    - That would be insane, wouldn't it?

## Upstairs neighbor at Carrer Furs

- I occasionally bump into a man in the lift in my building who grins, slightly lasciviously, at me when he sees me.
- He lives on one of the floors above me on my stairwell.
- Sometimes he is with, what I assume to be, his teenage daughter.
- They are both fair haired. He is perhaps 45 and reasonably good looking.
- He always grins at me in a sort of flirtatious way, but not quite flirtatious as he's not at all communicating with me.
- I now believe he was involved from the start and perhaps was already watching me. His grin, therefore, was more sinister.
- Is it possible this man was involved in poisoning or drugging the mains water that goes to my house, and/or managing a LAN network of hidden cameras? Or does he perhaps know who is involved in this?
- It seems reasonable to assume that everyone knows.

!!! info
    - More recently, in October 2024, I bumped into him again in the building's gardens and he was unable to look me in the eye. He seemed embarrassed.

## Online activity

- Over this period I'm occasionally shown violent rape porn on Twitter which shocks me to the core.
- It's not something I would ever look at and some of it looks very very real.
- I now believe this sort of thing was posted by Domingo the piano teacher and his associates to intimidate me.
