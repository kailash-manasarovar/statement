## Conservatory open day

- After one Saturday walking with the English ladies, including Christine Betterton Jones and Patricia Penny, where we were talking about music and my piano studies, I look up the conservatory website to find there's an open day for new students.
- I go along and meet Joan Carles Poquet and Paqui Fornet Pastor.
- They seem angry with me. They give me angry looks and are brusque with me.
- Even so, I apply and prepare for the exam.

!!! note "About me"
    - I love playing the piano; it's an absolute joy, and people's ridiculous attitudes cannot stop me.
    - I don't care if people don't like me. 
    - I don't expect people to try to murder me just because they don't like me. Especially when they are civil servants working in a government public school setting, and taking care of hundreds of children. That would be insane, wouldn't it?
