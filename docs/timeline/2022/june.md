## Preparing for the audition

- I am practicing in a piano room for the audition every day
- I "bump" into Maria Hontanilla who offers to help me
- Domingo is there on that initial meeting. There are two young students with him who are sort of giggly and excited when I speak to them. It's weird
- Maria suggests I'm her teacher, I agree

## Conservatory audition

- I go to the audition and pass it
- I'm scheduled to join for the third year professional studies in September
- At the audition, Domingo's female students are hanging around helping everyone. He's told them to dress in hot pants. All the girls are wearing hot pants.

## Summer

- I set off for trips/stays in UK and France for the whole summer
- Googlemaps starts sending me on bizarre journeys which include going down dirt tracks and I'm unable to see why
