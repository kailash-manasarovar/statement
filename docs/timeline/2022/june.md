## Preparing for the audition

- The head of studies, Jaume Signes, a trumpet teacher allows me to use Room 5, the trumpet teaching room, every day to practice my pieces for the audition.
- One day, Gloria Mu√±oz Pimentel (this is the name on the conservatory website currently: https://portal.edu.gva.es/conservatoridenia/es/centro/organigrama/), one of the receptionists, tells me I cannot use Room 5 as it's busy but there is a room free upstairs instead.

    - Gloria was instrumental in tormenting me throughout.
    - It's very curious to note she is listed as the representative of highly sensitive people on the conservatory website at the current time: *Representante del PAS*: https://portal.edu.gva.es/conservatoridenia/es/centro/organigrama/

    - What could this possibly mean? 
    - Is she the go to person for kids who are struggling with emotions during their studies?
    - I'm extremely concerned about this given her behavior with me which was wholly supportive of, and played an integral part in, bullying me at the conservatory, and wholly supportive of sexual grooming online, at a minimum.

- I go upstairs. Maria Hontanilla is standing outside a piano room and we meet and say hello.
- I realize now all this has been set up prior.
- Maria and I are talking and then Domingo comes up the stairs. Two young female students are with him.
- He goes to talk to Maria and the students are asking me questions. They are behaving oddly.
- They are sort of nervous, giggly, and excited when I speak to them. It's weird and, now, extremely concerning.
- Domingo leaves.
- Maria offers to help me with the audition and at some point suggests she is my teacher.
- It's all a bit contrived but I agree.

## Conservatory audition

- I go to the audition and pass it.
- I'm scheduled to join for the third year professional studies in September.
- At the audition, Domingo's female students are hanging around helping everyone. He's clearly told them to dress the same, and this includes hot pants. 
- He tells them to go and talk to people and they mill around talking to parents.
- It's a bit embarrassing.
