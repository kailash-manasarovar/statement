## Preparing for the audition

- The head of studies, Jaume Signes, a trumpet teacher, allows me to use his room, the trumpet teaching room, room 6, every day to practice my pieces for the audition on a stand up piano.
- One day, Gloria Muñoz Pimentel (this is the name on the [conservatory website currently](https://portal.edu.gva.es/conservatoriDénia/es/centro/organigrama/) although I thought her name was different, I could be wrong), one of the receptionists, tells me I cannot use the trumpet teaching room I've been using as it's busy, but there is a room free upstairs instead.

!!! tip "Gloria the receptionist"
    - Gloria was instrumental in tormenting me throughout and absolutely delighted at some of the nastier things I experienced.
    - She was fully involved too. She was always reading some "significant" book, or left something "significant" open, or on her desk, for me to see whenever I picked up a piano room key or brought it back after practicing.
    - It's very curious to note she is (at the time of writing) listed as the representative of highly sensitive people on the conservatory website at the current time: *Representante del PAS*: https://portal.edu.gva.es/conservatoriDénia/es/centro/organigrama/

    - What could this possibly mean? 
    - Is she the go to person for kids who are struggling with emotions during their studies, or those that are being bullied?
    - If the girls start feeling anxious and stressed, do they go to her so that she, in turn, informs Domingo or one of his cohort who might be worth targeting?
    - I'm extremely concerned about this given her behavior with me which was wholly supportive of, and played an integral part in, bullying me at the conservatory, and wholly supportive of sexual grooming online, at a minimum.

- I go upstairs. Maria Hontanilla is standing outside a piano room and we meet and say hello.
- I realize now all this has been set up prior.
- Maria and I are talking and then Domingo comes up the stairs. Two young female students are with him.
- He goes to talk to Maria and the students are asking me questions. They are behaving oddly.
- They are sort of nervous, giggly, and excited when I speak to them. It's weird and, now, extremely concerning.
- Domingo leaves.
- Maria offers to help me with the audition and at some point suggests she is my teacher.
- It's all a bit contrived but I agree.

## Conservatory audition

- I go to the audition and pass it.
- I'm scheduled to join for the third year professional studies in September.
- At the audition, Domingo's female students are hanging around helping everyone. He's clearly told them to dress the same, and this includes hot pants and skimpy tops. The girls are 14 or 15 years old.
- He tells the girls to go and talk to people, and they mill around talking to parents.
- His control over them is a bit embarrassing and I wonder if he's doing it to "show me".
