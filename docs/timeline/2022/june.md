## Preparing for the audition

- The head of studies, Jaume Signes, a trumpet teacher allows me to use Room 5, the trumpet teaching room, every day to practice my pieces for the audition.
- One day, Gloria the receptionist tells me I cannot use Room 5 as it's busy but there is a room free upstairs.
- I got upstairs.
- Maria Hontanilla is standing outside a piano room and we meet and say hello.
- I realize now all this is set up.
- Maria and I are talking and then Domingo comes up the stairs. Two young female students are with him.
- He goes to talk to Maria and the students are asking me questions. They are behaving oddly.
- They are sort of giggly and excited when I speak to them. It's weird.
- Domingo leaves.
- Maria offers to help me with the audition and at some point suggests she is my teacher.
- It's all a bit contrived but I agree.

## Conservatory audition

- I go to the audition and pass it.
- I'm scheduled to join for the third year professional studies in September.
- At the audition, Domingo's female students are hanging around helping everyone. He's clearly told them to dress the same, and this includes hot pants. 
- He tells them to go and talk to people and they mill around talking to parents.
- It's a bit embarrassing.
