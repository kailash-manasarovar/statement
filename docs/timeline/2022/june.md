## Preparing for the conservatory audition

- The head of studies, Jaume Signes, a trumpet teacher, allows me to use his room, the trumpet teaching room, room 6, every day to practice my pieces for the audition on a stand up piano.
- One day Gloria, one of the receptionists, tells me I cannot use the trumpet teaching room I've been using as it's busy, but there is a room free upstairs instead.

### Maria and Domingo

- I go upstairs. 
- Maria Hontanilla is standing outside a piano room and we meet and say hello.
- While Maria and I are talking, Domingo comes up the stairs. Two young female students are with him; minors of about 12 or 13 years old.
- It's all very contrived and set up.
- Domingo goes to talk to Maria and leaves the students to talk to me. They are behaving oddly.
- They are sort of nervous, giggly, and excited when I speak to them. It's weird and, now, extremely concerning.
- Domingo leaves without speaking to me.
- Maria offers to help me with the audition and at some point suggests she is my teacher.
- It's all a bit contrived but I agree.

### Gloria and the effects of poisoning

!!! tip "Gloria the receptionist"
    - Gloria was instrumental in tormenting me throughout the stalking while I was going to classes at the conservatory. 
    - She was always angry with me for reasons I could only guess at.
    - I strongly suspected that Domingo had told her some lie about me, perhaps that I had said something derogatory about her. Her attitude towards me had always been inexplicably hateful.
    - Unsurprisingly, she seemed to be absolutely delighted at some of the nastier things I experienced.
    - As the cyber-stalking progressed, and I came in to the conservatory for classes or to practice, she was always making some reaction to me; often related to something I had posted on Twitter, or she was reading some "significant" book, or leaving something "significant" open on her desk for me to see whenever I picked up a piano room key or brought it back after practicing.
    - It was boring and unimaginative. However, given I was also being drugged and poisoned without my knowledge, and given that the effects of continuous bullying became psychologically overwhelming, everything teachers and staff did to upset me had a sort of negatively exaggerated effect, as you might imagine it would.
    - At the original time of writing this particular admonition - November 2024 in Bangkok - Gloria was listed as the representative of highly sensitive people on the conservatory website: *Representante del PAS*: https://portal.edu.gva.es/conservatoridenia/es/centro/organigrama/
    - Well, I looked this up at the time and the definition of 'PAS' came up, specifically, as the "representative of highly sensitive people". 
    - I was horrified, of course.

    - However, I believe now that being led to this particular erroneous definition was due to constant online interference which was rather intense at that time.
    - I was also still being adversely affected by the toxicity in my apartment that I absorbed during the last couple of weeks of October 2024 when I got back from Portugal.
    - The security camera had malfunctioned for 6 days while I was away during which time, I believe, criminals entered my apartment and sprayed pesticides on all my belongings.
    - When I returned, I immediately became extremely unwell. 
    - My kidneys ached. I had migraines. I had shooting nerve pains all over my face. My sight started to seriously deteriorate.
    -  I had even been hallucinating during those two weeks. I only realized this, with a shock, in February 2025.
    - The toiletries that I had taken with me to Bangkok from Spain were also full of the same toxic substances.
    - I hadn't yet realized any of this at the time of writing.
    - Much of the first draft of this statement I wrote under those circumstances, and for this reason, I could have easily been misled by anyone controlling my online activity.

## Conservatory audition

- I go to the audition and pass it.
- I'm scheduled to join the conservatory again for the third year professional piano studies in September.
- At the audition, Domingo's female students are hanging around helping everyone. 
- The girls are all dressed in the same way; hot pants and skimpy tops. 
- The girls are 14 or 15 years old.
- He tells the girls to go and talk to people, and they mill around talking to parents.
- His control over them is embarrassing and cringeworthy.
