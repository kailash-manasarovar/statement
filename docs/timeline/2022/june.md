## Preparing for the conservatory audition

- The head of studies, Jaume Signes, a trumpet teacher, allows me to use his room, the trumpet teaching room, room 6, every day to practice my pieces for the audition on a stand up piano.
- One day, [Gloria Mu√±oz Pimentel](https://portal.edu.gva.es/conservatoridenia/es/centro/organigrama/), one of the receptionists, tells me I cannot use the trumpet teaching room I've been using as it's busy, but there is a room free upstairs instead.

### Gloria

!!! tip "Gloria the receptionist"
    - Gloria was instrumental in tormenting me throughout the stalking while I was going to classes at the conservatory. 
    - She seemed to be absolutely delighted at some of the nastier things I experienced.
    - As the cyber-stalking progressed, and I came in to the conservatory for classes or to practice, she was always making some reaction to me, or reading some "significant" book, or leaving something "significant" open or on her desk for me to see whenever I picked up a piano room key or brought it back after practicing.
    - It was boring and unimaginative. However, given I was also being drugged and poisoned without my knowledge at home, and given that the effects of continuous bullying did eventually become overwhelming, everything teachers and staff did to upset me had a sort of negatively exaggerated effect, as you might imagine it would.
    - She upset me. A lot.
    - At the original time of writing this admonition - November 2024 in Bangkok - Gloria was listed as the representative of highly sensitive people on the conservatory website: *Representante del PAS*: https://portal.edu.gva.es/conservatoridenia/es/centro/organigrama/
    - Well, I looked this up at the time and 'PAS' came up, specifically, as the "representative of highly sensitive people".

    - I think that being led to this particular definition was part of the online interference which was rather intense at that time.
    - I was also still being adversely affected by the last couple of weeks of October 2024 in my apartment which was *extremely* toxic - I realized in February I had been hallucinating during those weeks. 
    - My toiletries I had taken with me to Bangkok were also full of toxic substances and I hadn't yet realized this. 

### Maria and Domingo

- I go upstairs. Maria Hontanilla is standing outside a piano room and we meet and say hello.
- I realize now all this has been set up prior.
- Maria and I are talking and then Domingo comes up the stairs. Two young female students are with him, minors of about 12 or 13 years old.
- He goes to talk to Maria and the students are asking me questions. They are behaving oddly.
- They are sort of nervous, giggly, and excited when I speak to them. It's weird and, now, extremely concerning.
- Domingo leaves without speaking to me.
- Maria offers to help me with the audition and at some point suggests she is my teacher.
- It's all a bit contrived but I agree.

## Conservatory audition

- I go to the audition and pass it.
- I'm scheduled to join the third year professional studies in September.
- At the audition, Domingo's female students are hanging around helping everyone. He's clearly told them to dress in the same way, and this includes hot pants and skimpy tops. The girls are 14 or 15 years old.
- He tells the girls to go and talk to people, and they mill around talking to parents.
- His control over them is a bit embarrassing and I cringe.
