## Walking in Benijembla with the English ladies

- I was hiking with the English ladies every Saturday.
- One of the last Saturdays in November, 19th probably, we met at Benijembla, for a walk along the many trails around the village.
- Christine Betterton Jones, Patricia (Trish) Penny, and some of the others were there.
- Along the way we "bumped" into a small group of Spanish walkers, and Trish stayed back for a while to talk to them.
- We all noticed Trish wasn't with us at some point and Christine said she was talking with the Spanish people as she knew them.
- Trish reappeared at some point and we continued on.
- At the end of the walk we went for coffee in Benijembla.
- Trish and I were walking together back to the cars and she noticed the same group that she had seen up on the trail sitting at a table in a cafe.
- She told me she wanted to speak to this guy. As we walked towards them, he got up and, as if she didn't know him at all, even though he was the part of the same group we had met earlier, she asked him about something to do with the landscape and paths on a map that she had in her hand.
- I wasn't part of the chat and I noticed a woman who was sitting on the seat beside where this guy had got up from. I noticed she looked really sad.

!!! note
    - I assumed this woman was the man's wife or girlfriend and I wondered why she looked so unhappy.
    - Curiously, she looked a lot like the [girl in the video](../2023/june.md#youtube) I saw the following June.

- Trish Penny had her back to me, and she was showing this guy the map and asking question about it but it was as if, outside of my view, she was pointing to me, because he kept looking up at me and grinning. 
- His look reminded me of a look on one of the grooming gangs faces when I was 16. A man who had looked at me with delight before he raped me. A look of evil.
- You don't forget looks like that.

!!! warning
    - Was Trish trying to warn me about something?
    - I now believe that the look the trumpet teacher gave me was a look of recognition. 
    - He had seen me before; in pedophile rape porn from 1989. 
    - Of course, they had found the clips on the dark net, maybe even reached out to the perpetrators. They had detailed information from my statement that were eavesdropping on.
    - I believe this is what made them obsessed with me and plan the worst; for either monetary gain or because they're very very mentally unwell people, but it's probably mostly the money I expect.
    - I wonder how much in subscription fees a repeat rape-porn clip would earn on the porn networks?
    - I wonder if it's possible to claim such moneys back in litigation? Both from the original perpetrators and then again from the Dénia porn gangs.

## A sexualized 4-year-old at the Chinese bazaar

- One Saturday morning I head to the Chinese bazaar.
- A rough looking man is there with his tiny daughters, 4 and 2 probably.
- The 4-year-old is dressed like a cheap prostitute: platform stilettos, glittery mini-dress, garish make up, hair done up. It was horrifying.
- Given I now know they were tracking me via my mobile phone, I'm pretty sure this was another set up for me to see.

## The trumpet teacher

- At the end of November, 28th, all of a sudden, a trumpet teacher is found for the chamber music classes.
- Gloria, the receptionist at the conservatory, leaves a message on my phone to say class is starting. It's a weird message where I hear the word guapo (handsome) and someone says something in the background, Paqui Fornet probably, then they both laugh weirdly.
- I go to class that evening and the same guy who Trish was talking to in Benijembla is there, in Jaume's room where I had been allowed to practice for my audition.
- He says his name is Vidal.
- In the Generalitat Valenciana systems, his name was/is Vidal Sastre Sanchez Hornero. I believe this is a false name but there was no reason to think so at the time, other than when I asked him his name, and he answered Vidal, it didn't ring true somehow.
- So I came to class and we met, there was some immediate confusion about him needing the toilet, but he kept looking at his phone, and not really going anywhere, and then he was moving to the door, and he kept saying he was going to the toilet. It was weird and contrived.
- The toilet is just next door at the conservatory and I heard him bump into a woman and start talking to her.
- It was weird, they were talking, I was feeling a bit light headed and smiley. 
- I heard someone say my name, Katharine, and so I looked out of the door.
- He was standing over Ana Requena Marín, the violin teacher, talking to her softly.
- It sounds like he's telling her about why he's only just arrived at class. I don't understand what his reasons are.
- She was sort of slouching and looking embarrassed and answering him sheepishly. 
- He came back into class and I was feeling light-headed and a little high actually, smiley.
- I thought it was because I fancied him. He was an attractive man.
- Then the other student, Pablo Sesé Savall, a 14 year old boy, came to class. 
- The trumpet teacher kept looking at me with that same grin. It was disturbing.

## His other classes

- The trumpet teacher had two other classes; one was with the autistic girl, Candela Morales Lucas, 14 or so. She played the flute and a boy played the guitar to accompany.
- The other student he had was a doctor from the Dénia hospital, Joan, and his class was just before ours, 7-8pm.
- AFAIK he had no other classes and he only came to the conservatory on Monday evenings.

## Attendance

- The trumpet teacher skipped many many classes.
- All in all he probably turned up to teach about 50% of the classes we had scheduled.
- He (apparently) had the flu about 3 times.

## Skills and experience

- He appeared to have never been a teacher before, or was completely lazy and didn't care about what he was doing.
- I took over the classes a little bit.

## Flirting

- He started to flirt with me immediately; in a kind of garish ignorant way which seemed totally phoney to me.

## Death of a teacher

- There was an untimely death of a young male teacher around this time. I wonder now if it was suicide.
