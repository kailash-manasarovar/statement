## Walking in Benijembla with the English ladies

- I was going hiking with the English ladies every Saturday
- One of the last weeks in November, 19th probably, I walked with them around Benijembla
- Christine Betterton Jones, Patricia (Trish) Penny, and some of the others were there
- Along the way we "bumped" into a group of Spanish walkers and Trish stayed back for a while to talk to them
- Trish reappeared at some point and we continued
- At the end of the walk we went for coffee in Benijembla
- Trish and I were walking together back to the cars and she saw the same group she had seen up on the trail sitting at a table in a cafe
- She told me she wanted to speak to this guy. He got up and she asked him about something to do with the landscape and paths
- Her back was to me, and she was showing him the map and asking question but it was as if, outside of my view, she was pointing to me, because he kept looking up at me and grinning 
- His look reminded me of a look on one of the grooming gangs faces when I was 16
- It was the look of a grown man to something he is excited about consuming in a very negative way

## The trumpet teacher

- At the end of November, 28th, all of a sudden, a trumpet teacher is found
- Gloria, the receptionist at the conservatory, leaves a message on my phone to say class is starting. It's a weird message where I hear the word guapo (handsome) and then she laughs weirdly
- I go to class and the same guy who Trish was talking to in Benijembla was there
- He says his name is Vidal
- In the Generalitat systems, his name is Vidal Sastre Sanchez Hornero (I believe this is a false name but there was no reason to think so at the time, other than when I asked him his name, when he said Vidal it didn't ring true somehow)
- So I came to class and we met, there was some confusion about him needing the toilet, but he kept looking at his phone, and not really moving, and then he was moving to the toilet, he kept saying he was going to the toilet, it was weird
- The toilet is just next door to room 5 at the conservatory and I heard him bump into a woman and start talking
- It was weird, they were talking, I was becoming a bit light headed, I heard my name said, Katharine, and so I looked out of the door
- He was standing over Ana Requena the violin teacher talking to her softly
- She was sort of slouching and looking embarassed and answering sheepishly
- He came back into class and I was feeling light-headed and a little high actually, smiley
- I thought it was because I fancied him
- Then the other student - a 14 year old boy - came to class and we played a little. The trumpet teacher kept looking at me with that same grin. It was disturbing

## His other classes

- Let's call him Vidal for want of a real name for now
- He had two other classes; one was the autistic girl, Candela about 15,  playing flute and a guitarist (I can't remember who this guy was)
- The other class was a doctor from the Denia hospital, Joan, and his class was just before ours.
- AFAIK he had no other classes and only came on Monday evenings.

## Attendance

- Vidal skipped many many classes 
- All in all he probably turned up to teach about 50% of the classes we had
- He had the flu about 3 times

## Skills and experience

- Vidal appeared to have never been a teacher before or was completely lazy and didn't care about what he was doing
- I took over the classes a little bit

## Flirting

- Vidal started to flirt with me immediately
