##Â Bullying starts

- I feel like people are talking about me negatively at the conservatory
- I hear the word "coffee" a lot and relate it to me complaining that Domingo invited me for coffee and he shouldn't have 
- I'm having a hard time at work
- I'm stressing unecessarily all the time
- I have a sense that something is going on that I'm unaware of
- There is still no teacher for chamber music

## Trish Penny

- I'm surprised to meet Trish Penny after so many years and notice how much she has aged.
- I tell Christine BJ this. She obviously tells Trish what I've said because the next time I see Trish she is angry with me.
- I'm upset about this but people are people.
- I attempt to talk to Trish in a friendly way and I talk about my life.
- She mentions a man who lived near her who had really scary eyes.
- It was weird and reminded me of a short story I had written for the writing club I used to be a member of in Denia in 2007 when I started to write about child sexual abuse and grooming gangs in short-story form and I had described one of the pedophiles with the very words she used.
