## Bullying starts

- People are talking about me negatively at the conservatory; cold looks, weird laughter, a frosty feeling.
- I hear the word "coffee" a lot and relate it to me complaining that Domingo invited me for coffee and he shouldn't have back in 2014.
- I'm having a hard time at work too.
- I'm stressing unnecessarily.
- I have a strong sense that something sinister is going on that I'm unaware of.
- There is still no teacher for chamber music.

## Patricia "Trish" Penny

- I'm surprised to meet Trish Penny on a hike with the English ladies after so many years. I notice how much she has aged.
- I tell Christine BJ this. She obviously tells Trish what I've said because the next time I see Trish she is angry with me.
- I'm upset about this but people are people.
- I attempt to talk to Trish in a friendly way to make amends, and I talk about my life.
- She mentions a man who lived near her who had really scary eyes.
- It was weird and reminded me of a short story I had written for the writing club I used to be a member of in Dénia in 2007, which incidentally David the gay English teacher was also a member of.
- This was when I started to write about child sexual abuse and grooming gangs in short-story form and I had described one of the pedophiles with the exact words she used in our conversation.
