## Being sick in the flat

- When I arrived back from holiday, I noticed horrible brown streaks along the inside of the fridge and I am convinced that there are parasites in the flat and that is what has been making me so sick.
- Furthermore, I had set a security camera up in the flat to record anything weird for the whole time I was away, which was nearly three months.
- During that time, an enormous fly triggered the camera from time to time.
- I have vomited a lot in the flat.
- I ask Bea to replace the fridge as it's ancient and I tell her I am sick a lot.
- She replaces the fridge immediately.
- I continue to be sick a lot.

## Bullying starts quietly

- People are talking about me negatively at the conservatory; cold looks, weird laughter, a frosty feeling.
- I hear the word "coffee" a lot and relate it to me complaining that Domingo invited me for coffee back in 2014, and he shouldn't have.
- I'm having a hard time at work too.
- I'm stressing unnecessarily.
- I have a strong sense that something sinister is going on that I'm unaware of. 
- There is still no teacher for chamber music.

## Patricia "Trish" Penny

- I'm surprised to meet Trish Penny on a hike with the English ladies after so many years. She seems sad. I notice how much she has aged.
- I tell Christine BJ this. She obviously tells Trish what I've said because the next time I see Trish she is angry with me.
- I'm upset about this but people are people, and often can't be trusted to not share hurtful information.
- I attempt to talk to Trish in a friendly way to make amends, and I talk about my life.
- She mentions a man, a British policeman, who lived near her who had really scary eyes.
- It was weird and reminded me of a short story I had written for the writing club I used to go to in Dénia in 2007, which incidentally David the gay English teacher was also a member of.
- This was when I had started to write about child sexual abuse and grooming gangs in short-story form, and I had described one of the pedophiles with the exact words she used in our conversation.

!!! note
    - Could this have been a warning from Trish? Or were my British friends 100% complicit.

## Halloween

- On the run up to Halloween I notice that, outside my flat and in full view from the window, an effigy is hanging off a lamppost. It feels sinister, especially considering Lorraine Blackbourn hung herself.
