## Sam shares some files with me

- [Samuel](september.md#harmony), in a friendly and helpful manner, shares some files with me regarding the harmony class homework via email.
- This is his email contact:

!!! info "[Choker seed](march.md#planting-the-choker-seeds)"
    - I asked Samuel why his email was called Max Power.
    - He did not answer my question.
    - I now believe this was another [choker seed](march.md#planting-the-choker-seeds).
    - There were continual notifications on X via fake accounts and on manipulated Google search results for a long time that the brand the stalkers and voyeurs use to distribute porn is Max Power.
    - Making this connection explains why Samuel simply stopped talking to me after my ['funeral' on 12th June 2023](../2023/june.md#last-class-my-funeral-apparently) at the end of the 3rd year. 
    - I was not supposed to return to the conservatory after that and people like Samuel, who had been helping the criminal gangs out, would have finished their obligations and been paid I suspect.

- Every time we walk home together, Samuel tells me he is planning to take a costly TEFL course online the following summer.

## Vomiting and sickness in the flat

- When I arrived back from holiday in September, I noticed horrible brown streaks along the inside of the fridge and on the floor.
- I become convinced that there are parasites in the flat and that is what has been making me so sick.
- Furthermore, I had set a security camera up in the flat to record anything weird during the whole time I was away, which was nearly three months.
- During that time, an enormous fly triggered the camera from time to time.
- I was vomiting a lot in the flat and it was not normal vomiting either. It was not like food-poisoning vomiting, it was more like anything I ate just sat in my stomach, digestion not starting at all, and it would all come up just chewed up, often a great deal of it. 
- It was strange. I have only ever vomited like that in the apartment.
- I ask Bea to replace the fridge as it's ancient. I tell her at that time that I am being sick a lot.
- She replaces the fridge immediately.
- I continue to be sick a lot.

## Bullying starts quietly

- People are talking about me negatively at the conservatory; cold looks, weird laughter, a frosty feeling.
- I hear the word "coffee" a lot and relate it to me complaining that [Domingo invited me for coffee back in 2014](../early-years/2014.md#he-gets-to-me), and he shouldn't have.
- I'm having a hard time at work too.
- I'm stressing unnecessarily.
- I have a strong sense that something sinister is going on that I'm unaware of. 
- I start to have bad dreams.
- There is still no teacher for chamber music.

## Patricia

- I'm surprised to meet Patricia on a hike with the English ladies after so many years. She seems sad. I notice how much she has aged.
- I forgot that I saw her at Christmas but she was sitting at another table and it was dark in the house afterwards.
- I tell Christine that I'm surprised at how much she has aged. She obviously tells Patricia what I've said because the next time I see Patricia she is angry with me.

!!! info "Gang stalking tactics"
    - People setting up situations in which they might be randomly angry with me for no particular reason became pretty standard gang-stalking activity.
    - This may have been the same day that, while we were at coffee, Patricia was telling us all about how she had taken speed and other drugs.
    - I had switched off at that point and was talking to someone else but from the periphery I remember they were talking about a Spanish brothel owner who had been in Finland and returned. It sounded like everyone knew who she was talking about.
    - I believe now she may have been referencing the trumpet teacher, or grooming gang members.
    - If that is true, the implication is that the "sex" industry has infiltrated the school systems in Spain, and controls it to an extent.

- I'm unaware of the conspiracy at this time, and so I'm upset about my words hurting someone unintentionally but people are people, and often can't be trusted to not share hurtful information.
- I attempt to talk to Patricia in a friendly way to make amends, and I talk about my life.
- She mentions a man, a British policeman, who lived near her who had really scary eyes.
- It was a weird thing for her to mention, and she repeated it. 
- It reminded me of a short story I had written for the writing club I used to go to in Dénia in 2007, which incidentally [Dandy the gay English teacher](../early-years/2013.md#the-gays-leave-suddenly) was also a member of.
- This was a piece I wrote at the time I started to write about child sexual abuse and grooming gangs in short-story form. I had described one of the pedophiles, Winston M, with the exact words she used in our conversation.

!!! note
    - Could this have been a warning from Patricia? Or were my British friends 100% complicit.
    - It seems likely now that Hazel Smith would have gotten this information from her friendship with Dandy and passed it onto Patricia, who is a clear associate, with instructions to repeat it, [choker seed style](march.md#planting-the-choker-seeds). 

## Halloween

- On the run up to Halloween I notice that, outside my flat and in full view from the window, an effigy is hanging from a lamppost. 

![Effigy](../../content/images/threats/effigy-2.png)

- This feels extremely sinister, especially considering Elaine Black hung herself.
