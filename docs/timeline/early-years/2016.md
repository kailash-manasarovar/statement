## January

- I visit London and give a video interview with a Metropolitan police detective, Lauren Ott, and a female colleague of hers.
- It was difficult but ultimately an extremely positive experience. They believed me.
- The process re-traumatized me, however, and put me on the road to severe depression and extreme anxiety.
- My family were disinterested and said extraordinarily hurtful things to me, such as:

!!! quote "Blaming and dismissing the victims of rape gangs"
    - You shouldn't go to the police. 
    - They all probably have families and kids now.
    - You chose your friends. 
    - All those men that had you.
    - Etc.
    
- My family have never acknowledged any of this, never mind apologized, and I expect and get similar, even at the time of writing. 
- While I was in a deeply traumatized state, however, any time they said anything like this to me, it felt like a stab in the heart. They broke my heart with these sick attitudes, in fact. 
- These continuing experiences, that every rape victim will recognize, inspired a story: [Not all bus drivers](https://medium.com/@forgivenet/not-all-bus-drivers-5caf8f5fa083).

- The police carry out their investigation and, I believe, talk to everyone I mention in my statement.

!!! info "I wonder who spoke fairly of me to the police? Anyone?"
    - I do wonder sometimes how many of the people I mentioned in my initial statement; friends, parents of friends, etc, put the pedophile-pornographers first by saying dispicable things about me.
    - Nothing would surprise me.

- They arrest without charge the main protagonist Winston M on the basis of my claims. He stays arrested for nearly 10 months.
- The man was already well known to the police and had been in prison more than once.
- Him, his mates I mentioned, and most certainly his accomplice - whose name I never remembered but my friends at the time had met him - were likely police informants.
- I felt really hopeful about finally getting some justice and wondered if there were any more cases just like mine.
- While all this is going on, I'm continuing with year 2 of professional piano studies at the conservatory in Dénia.

## March

- I am looking for work as a Java developer.
- I am either headhunted or apply for a job that comes up in Alicante.
- I am interviewed online by a man who explains that his company does scientific research into sexually transmitted diseases and they need a developer. However, I would be looking at genitals every day. 
- It's disappointing. I don't want to be looking at genitals every day.
- I tell Porsche about this. She has been asking about my job hunting a lot. I remark that the last thing I want to be doing every day is looking at genitals. She says something to the effect that I shouldn't be concerned and it's a job. I tell her it would make me feel a bit sick.
- A few days later, without warning, Porsche asks me for the name of the company and even asks me to spell it for her. She takes out a pen and paper and writes down the name of the company. We are at the door of the conservatory when she does this.
- I wonder why this information is so important to her.
- The guy who interviewed me never contacts me again. I'm ghosted, although weirdly I believe I see him in Dénia a few days later.
- I believe at the time, and now, that Dominic is behind me losing a job opportunity like this. I assume that Porsche probably phoned up the company and maligned me at Dominic's request.
- To back up that suspicion, Klara Sarkadi had previously told me that Porsche had phoned her up at some point and put on a silly voice pretending she was someone else and asked her stupid questions.
- Now I'm not so sure about my initial suspicions. I believe instead that the man who interviewed me and Dominic knew each other. It seems more likely that Dominic simply instructed Porsche point-by-point, to say this thing, and that thing, and she obeyed, so that I would assume she was maligning me behind my back.

!!! important "The trumpet teacher?"
    - I now believe the man I had the interview with is the same man who acted as trumpet teacher at the conservatory in 2022/23; a man who was able to get recruited as a teacher in a public school for the sole purpose of terrorizing and sexually grooming at least one student, probably more.

## April

- My parents visit me for a few days.
- They stay in the Hotel Costa Blanca.
- My mum gets sick during the night and goes to the emergency room in Dénia. They don't tell me about this until the next day
- She had become extremely anxious and shaking, her heart racing, and she was very scared because of her high blood pressure.
- She went to the emergency room and they gave her a sedative and she was completely fine.
- She put it down to the two coffees she'd had.

!!! danger "Spiking willy-nilly in Dénia? Even all the way back then?"
    - I now wonder if she had also been somehow "medicated".
    - I remember [the night I had stayed there](2014.md#first-piano-class-at-the-end-end-of-september) after my first piano class with Dominic and how I felt like I had been spiked with drugs.

## May

- I join an informal yoga class near to my house in Joan Fuster.
- One morning, I do a face-mask at home before yoga.
- When I go to the yoga class, one of the women says hi, points at her face, circles her finger around her face, and then points at me, and circles her finger around her face again, and says very nice, and smiles weirdly.
- I'm really surprised. Her actions make me think she has seen me with my face-mask on but that's not possible.
- I think nothing more of it.

### Planning to leave

- I plan to leave Dénia and go traveling.
- I am starting to become depressed by everything that's happened with regards to the child sexual abuse and police action, and so I hope to get some relief and peace by attending fasting, yoga, meditation, and healing retreats in Asia.
- Maria, my piano teacher, seems desperate to convince me to stay. We have this discussion every class; about how I can stay, what job I can get.
- She says I can get a job at the Dénia hospital as a computer specialist and that she will organize it. 
- Dominic is obviously behind this.

## Asia

- I attend yoga and meditation retreats in India, Thailand, and Myanmar.
- I'm full of anguish about everything that's happened and I don't feel like I'm getting any better.
- While in Kerala, at an ayurvedic retreat, I see a UK documentary about a woman police officer returning to work after a career break. She was wearing a secret camera to report on the outrageous things going on in the police service.
- In one scene, a fellow officer shows her some porn on his mobile phone. It is a woman in a field with horses. The two male officers are laughing.
- I find this commonplace attitude to serious crimes against women utterly horrific.
- When I get onto Twitter in 2021, and connect with the women's movement, I tweet about this: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1444576152086097925.
- You can see the documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=jOlnhjDX30E&t=755s.

## End of October, early November 

- The Crown Prosecution Service changes the charging criteria for rape.
- I speak to Lauren when I'm in India and she tells me they're not charging the man they've arrested.
- I'm devastated and quickly slip into a more serious depression.
- I'm feeling constantly suicidal.
- I have nowhere to go, so I go home.
- Dad is supportive and kind, my mother and brother are not at all.
- My GP in London puts me on medication and the suicidal thoughts stop instantly.
- I put on about 1.5 stone in 2 weeks and feel lethargic and unwell.
