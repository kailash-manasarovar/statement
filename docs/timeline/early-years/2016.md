## January at the Met

- I went to the Met and did a video interview with a police officer there Lauren ..
- It was a positive experience
- I was retraumatized however
- My family were utterly disinterested in what was going on for me
- The police talk to everyone I mentioned and arrest one of the protagonists on the basis of my claims
- This guy was well known to the police and had been in prison more than once
- I felt hopeful for justice

## Looking for work

- I am looking for work as a Java developer
- I am either headhunted or apply to a job in Alicante
- I am interviewed by a man who explains they do research into sexually transmitted diseases and need a developer but I would be looking at genitals every day
- I am not impressed
- I tell Mercedes about this. Mercedes asks me for the name of the company and even asks me to spell it for her
- The guy who interviewed me never gets in contact again
- I believe at the time, and now, that Domingo is behind all of this and Mercedes probably phoned up the company and maligned me which made the guy ghost me
- To back up that suspicion, Klari Sarkadi had previously told me that Mercedes had phone her up and put on a silly voice pretending she was someone else

## Parents visited April

- Mum and dad came to visit me that year
- They stayed in the hotel Costa Blanca
- My mum got sick and had to go to A&E but they didn't tell me till the next day
- She had become extremely very anxious and shaking, her heart racing and was scared because of her high blood pressure
- She went to the emergency room and they gave her a sedative and she was completely fine
- She put it down to the two coffees she'd had but I'm not so sure now

## Yoga in Denia April or May

- I join a yoga class 
- One morning I do a facepack at home before yoga
- When I go to yoga class, one of the women there points at her face, circles her finger around it, and then points at me and says very nice and smiles weirdly
- I'm really surprised. Her actions make me think she has seen me with my facemask on but that's not possible
- I think nothing more of it 

## Planning to leave

- I plan to leave Denia and go traveling
- I am starting to become depressed and so hope to get some relief by doing yoga and healing retreats in India and Thailand

## October or November 

- CPS changes charging criteria for rape
- The police phone me when I'm in India and tell me they're not charging
- I'm devastated and slip into a more serious depression
- I have nowhere to go so I go home
- I'm feeling constantly suicidal
- My GP in London puts me on medication and the thoughts stop instantly
- I put on about 1.5 stone in 2 weeks and feel lethargic and unwell
