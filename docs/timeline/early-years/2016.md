## January at the Met

I went to the Met and did a video interview with a police officer there Lauren ..
It was a positive experience
I was retraumatized however
My family were utterly disinterested in what was going on for me
The police talk to everyone I mentioned and arrest one of the protagonists on the basis of my claims
This guy was well known to the police and had been in prison more than once
I felt hopeful for justice

## Yoga in Denia April or May

I join a yoga class 
One morning I do a facepack at home before yoga
When I go to yoga class, one of the women there points at her face, circles her finger around it, and then points at me and says very nice and smiles weirdly
I'm really surprised. Her actions make me think she has seen me with my facemask on but that's not possible
I think nothing more of it 

## Planning to leave

I plan to leave Denia and go traveling
I am starting to become depressed and so hope to get some relief by doing yoga and healing retreats in India and Thailand

## October or November 

CPS changes charging criteria for rape
The police phone me when I'm in India and tell me they're not charging
I'm devastated and slip into a more serious depression
I have nowhere to go so I go home
I'm feeling constantly suicidal
My GP in London puts me on medication and the thoughts stop instantly
I put on about 1.5 stone in 2 weeks and feel lethargic and unwell
