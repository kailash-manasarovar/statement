## January

- I visit London and give a video interview with a Metropolitan police detective, Lauren Ott, and a female colleague of hers.
- It was difficult but ultimately an extremely positive experience. They believed me and I had hope for some justice.
- The process re-traumatized me, however, and put me on the road to a debilitating depression coupled with extreme anxiety from retriggered PTSD.
- My family were disinterested and said extraordinarily hurtful things to me.
- Unfortunately, the world tends to blame women for the vile acts of men.
- While I was in a deeply traumatized state, however, any time they said anything like this to me, it felt like a stab in the heart. They broke my heart, in fact, and eventually I had to get away from them to survive.
- These continuing experiences, that every rape victim will recognize, inspired a story: [Not all bus drivers](https://medium.com/@forgivenet/not-all-bus-drivers-5caf8f5fa083).

[![Not all bus drivers](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/0*VWSen-0kx7mIPuWg)](https://medium.com/@forgivenet/not-all-bus-drivers-5caf8f5fa083)

- The police carry out their investigation and, I believe, talk to everyone I mention in my statement.

!!! info "I wonder who spoke fairly of me to the police? Anyone?"
    - I do wonder sometimes how many of the people I mentioned in my initial statement; friends, parents of friends, etc, put the pedophile-pornographers first by saying despicable things about me.
    - Nothing would surprise me.

- They arrest without charge the main protagonist Winston M on the basis of my claims. He stays arrested for nearly 10 months while the police investigate.
- The man was already well known to the police and had been in prison more than once.
- Him, all his mates that I mentioned, and most certainly his main accomplice - a man whose name I never remembered but my friends at the time had met him - were likely police informants.
- I felt really hopeful about finally getting some justice and felt pretty sure there must have been more cases like mine.
- While all this is going on, I'm continuing with year 2 of professional piano studies at the conservatory in Dénia.

## March

- I am looking for work as a Java developer.
- I am either headhunted or apply for a job that comes up in Alicante.
- I am interviewed online by a man who explains that his company does scientific research into sexually transmitted diseases and they need a developer. However, I would be looking at genitals every day. 
- It's disappointing. I don't want to be looking at genitals every day.
- I tell Mercedes about this. She has been somewhat over-interested in my job hunting. I remark that the last thing I want to be doing every day is looking at genitals. She says something to the effect that I shouldn't be concerned and it's a job. I tell her it would make me feel a bit sick.
- A few days later, without warning, Mercedes asks me for the name of the company and even asks me to spell it for her. She takes out a pen and paper and writes down the name of the company. We are at the door of the conservatory when she does this.
- I wonder why this information is so important to her.
- The guy who interviewed me never contacts me again. I'm ghosted, although weirdly I believe I see him in Dénia a few days later.
- I believe at the time, and now, that Domingo is behind me losing a job opportunity like this. I assume that Mercedes probably phoned up the company and maligned me at Domingo's request.
- To back up that suspicion, Klara Sarkadi had previously told me that Mercedes had phoned her up at some point and put on a silly voice pretending she was someone else and asked her stupid questions.
- Now I'm not so sure about my initial suspicions. I believe instead that the man who interviewed me and Domingo knew each other. It seems more likely that Domingo simply instructed Mercedes point-by-point, to say this thing, and that thing, and she obeyed, so that I would assume she was maligning me behind my back.

!!! important "The trumpet teacher?"
    - I now believe the man I had the interview with is the same man who acted as trumpet teacher at the conservatory in 2022/23; a man who was able to get recruited as a teacher in a public school for the sole purpose of terrorizing and sexually grooming at least one student, probably more.

## April

- My parents visit me for a few days.
- They stay in the Hotel Costa Blanca.
- My mum gets sick during the night and goes to the emergency room in Dénia.
- Dad has decided I'm not to be told about it until the following day when they tell me over dinner.
- He has decided that it would be better for me if I was not told immediately.
- Perhaps I may have seen something suspicious if I'd been called round when it was happening?
- Given the [concerns I have about my father's previous visit in 2015](2015.md#end-of-year-piano-concert) and my [anal injury at that time](2015.md#colitis-symptoms), not forgetting my [inexplicable experience at the Hotel Costa Blanca in 2014](2014.md#) after my first piano class with Domingo Lopez Cano, I really have to be concerned about this now.
- My mother had become extremely anxious and shaking, her heart racing, and she was very scared because of her high blood pressure.
- She thought she was having a heart attack.
- Did they get the dose wrong or was her whole body reacting to something very wrong?
- She went to the emergency room and they gave her a sedative and she was completely fine.
- She put it down to the two coffees she'd had.

!!! danger "Spiking willy-nilly in Dénia? Even all the way back then?"
    - I now wonder if she had also been somehow "medicated".
    - I remember [the night I had stayed there](2014.md#first-piano-class-at-the-end-end-of-september) after my first piano class with Domingo and how I felt like I had been spiked with drugs.

- Incidentally, the hotel manager was very angry about something, my parents told me, and I remembered he had been the same with me the year before.

## May

### Evidence the town is surveilling me without my knowledge?

- I join an informal yoga class near to my house in Joan Fuster.
- One morning, I do a face-mask at home before yoga.
- When I go to the yoga class, one of the women says hi, points at her face, circles her finger around her face, and then points at me, and circles her finger around her face again, and says "very nice", and smiles weirdly.
- I'm really surprised. Her actions make me think she has seen me with my face-mask on but that's not possible.
- I think nothing more of it.

### Planning to leave

- I plan to leave Dénia and go traveling.
- I am starting to become depressed by everything that's happened with regards to the child sexual abuse and police action, and so I hope to get some relief and peace by attending fasting, yoga, meditation, and healing retreats in Asia.
- Maria, my piano teacher, seems desperate to convince me to stay. We have this discussion every class; about how I can stay, what job I can get.
- She says I can get a job at the Dénia hospital as a computer specialist and that she will organize it. 
- Domingo is obviously behind this.

## The British woman and her poisoned husband

- At the end of the 2nd year of piano studies, I play a mini-concert at the Dénia Club Nautico.
- A British woman comes to watch.
- She lives in Pedreguer with her husband.
- She is with another woman I know, who I now can't remember.
- She makes a fuss about how good I was.
- The woman behaves strangely, as if she has power over everyone. She's rather unpleasant.
- She has a hobby making dolls and adding them to dolls houses.
- I guess she wants me to think this is sinister.
- She says she's a witch repeatedly, but offers no more information.
- I know a lot of witches, in Glastonbury and beyond, so it's not a big deal to me.
- She arranges a Chinese dinner and brings her husband the next time we go out.
- The woman from Pedreguer's husband looks extremely unwell.
- He had lung cancer (or some other cancer) and had been treated for it in the hospital and even though he's only 60 he looks about 100.
- He is yellow and losing his hair. He cannot walk without sticks.
- We all assume it is the cancer treatment, but he complains he's not getting better, he's getting worse.
- She says she is poisoning him.
- He confirms this.
- I think they are both joking.

## Asia

- I attend yoga and meditation retreats in India, Thailand, and Myanmar.
- I'm full of anguish about everything that's happened and I don't feel like I'm getting any better.
- While in Kerala, at an ayurvedic retreat, I see a UK documentary about a woman police officer returning to work after a career break. She was wearing a secret camera to report on the outrageous things going on in the police service.
- In one scene, a fellow officer shows her some porn on his mobile phone. It is a woman in a field with horses. The two male officers are laughing.
- I find this commonplace attitude to serious crimes against women utterly horrific.
- When I get onto Twitter in 2021, and connect with the women's movement, I tweet about this: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1444576152086097925.
- You can see the documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=jOlnhjDX30E&t=755s.

## End of October, early November 

- The Crown Prosecution Service changes the charging criteria for rape.
- I speak to Lauren when I'm in India and she tells me they're not charging the man they've arrested, Winston May.
- I'm devastated and slip into a more serious depression.
- I'm feeling constantly suicidal.
- I'm in Myanmar.
- I call my dad and tell him I can't stop thinking about killing myself.
- He cries.
- I suddenly feel like I have one friend in the world.
- I go home.
- My dad is very supportive.
- On more than one occasion he says it's all his fault.
- I assume he is talking about the big picture.
- While dad is supportive and kind, my mother and brother are not at all.
- They say and do things that feel like they are stabbing me in the heart.
- My GP in London puts me on medication and the suicidal thoughts stop instantly.
- I put on about 1.5 stone in 2 weeks and feel lethargic and unwell.
- While I'm at home, my dad and brother meet at night at the front door and, while I'm trying to get to sleep, they talk loudly and meaningfully about what a good bloke Hitler was.
- It's intolerable.
