## Mike Wenham

- I'm back in the UK and I get my first job in programming as a junior Java developer for a e-commerce company owned by British Telecom.
- I love the job.
- I'm one of two women in a department of many men.
- The other woman is being bullied, relentlessly. It's ugly.
- I don't know how to help her. It's my first job as a programmer and I want to do well.
- About four months after I start, she walks out.
- The team sing, 'Ding dong the witch is dead'.
- Another man, Peter, walks out in disgust at the same time.
- The bullying reverts to me immediately.
- Porn on my screen. Rape jokes.
- It's relentless and overwhelming.
- I realize I will never advance in an environment like this, and leave.
- My boss, Mike Wenham, is furious and tries to get me to stay.
