## Jitendra Das

- Even with a PhD in Computer Science, I find it impossible to get a junior position as programmer.
- I decide to travel to India to get professional Java qualifications.
- At the same time, I intend to do some intensive yoga activities.
- I search for a yoga course online.
- The only course that comes up, again and again as the first option in search, is a course in Rishikesh run by a Jitendra Das.
- There are hundreds of yoga courses and ashrams in Rishikesh. 
- I found it weird and *significant* that only his course was coming up in search.
- I never considered online manipulation by bad actors. Ever. Not once.
- I signed up.
- He wanted students to send photos, which I found weird. I can't remember if I sent one. Maybe.
- Anyway, after the computer courses, I went to study yoga.
- Jitendra Das was a sexual pervert.
- Actually, in truth he was a lost soul who had been doing intensive spiritual practices while young for long periods and had made huge progress in yoga.
- However, something made him lose his way and he had clearly become a rampant sex addict with no control of himself at all.
- He targeted me as a *lover*.
- Now, I was not interested but, at that time, I had no boundaries.
- It was not that long after having remembered gang rape and I was still injured emotionally, mentally, and spiritually from the trauma.
- Although I gave a bit of a fight, a man like Jitendra who had no respect at all for women just pushed his way in and I seemingly lost any ability to say no.
- We had a lot of sex.
- And all of it was quite unpleasant too.
- I found it impossible to say no and stay in my hotel.
- It was like I was enchanted, bewitched.
- One night, I saw a demon-like being in his second chakra.
- I realized his addiction, however it had begun, had drawn a spiritual parasite into his energetic field.
- I saw that he really couldn't help himself and probably would need an exorcism of some sort to have any hope at all of getting well.
- Yet, he wasn't aware he had a problem, so that probably would never happen.
- Anyway, it was a very unpleasant month with Jitendra and it unbalanced me mentally and emotionally as you might expect, and it took a long time to get over it.
- I thought I was in love with him. 
- He was doing very powerful sorcery.
- When I realized I was not in love with him, about a year later, it was most liberating, but it took some intense meditative practices.
- Anyway, that was that ...except...
- A few years later, I noticed he was doing courses in Valencia with a yoga teacher there.
- Jitendra usually worked with a Ukrainian team who organized trips out to India and it was obvious, to me at least, they were bringing women out to have sex with him.
- He had visited Kiev too at some point.
- He showed me some professional photos he had done there. 
- There were hundreds of professional shots of him in various yoga poses wearing tiny red pants; his substantial tackle most obvious.
- I'm guessing he was probably starring in porn somewhere too.
- Would he have been aware of that if he was? Probably not all of it.
- Was he also doing the spy-cam thing back in 2010?
- Am I in even more porn without knowing it?
- If so, was I targeted yet again by the same conspirators with connections in the Valencian region?
- My goodness this gets a bit tiring and ridiculous doesn't it.
- One of the most curious things about my experience in India was a Mrs VD Stain (phonetic spelling) who was also a student in the class.
- She was a curiously ugly person, and I suspect was also having sex with Jitendra when she wasn't having sex with someone she'd just met in a cafe.
- She was running game on me for Jitendra too. I remember one instance of her making a huge drama, tears, etc, with the intention of getting information out of me, for him I assumed.
- She was rather like Sally, in retrospect.
- One of the team too?

!!! info "Instructions"
    - That was something I never suspected, until this morning when I woke up.
    - Indeed, most of my sordid past I had hoped not to have to relive so openly like this.
    - Needs must, and when you're pushed into a corner ... well ... what to do.
    - I hope it's helpful.

## Mike Wenham

- I'm back in the UK and I get my first job in programming as a junior Java developer for a e-commerce company owned by British Telecom.
- I love the job.
- I'm one of two women in a department of many men.
- The other woman is being bullied, relentlessly. It's ugly.
- I don't know how to help her. It's my first job as a programmer and I want to do well.
- About four months after I start, she walks out.
- The men sing, 'Ding dong the witch is dead'.
- Another man, Peter, walks out in disgust at the same time.
- The bullying reverts to me immediately.
- Porn on my screen. Rape jokes.
- It's relentless and overwhelming.
- I realize I will never advance in a brutal and hostile environment like this, and leave.
- My boss, Mike Wenham, is furious and tries to get me to stay.

!!! info "Two weeks before I hand in my notice"
    - I hand in my notice on the run up to the New Year.
    - Mike was moonlighting as a builder and had an account on one of the builder platforms.
    - Two weeks before I left, Mike had been doing building work in a maisonette in Lesley Road very near to my street in East Finchley, literally the next road.
    - He had asked me to come and see him there one Saturday morning. It must have been December 4th or 11th of 2010.
    - I wasn't sure why he was asking me to pop over, I just thought friendliness.
    - Anyway, I went along and he let me in, or the door was open and he was at the top of the stairs. 
    - He was carrying a stanley knife.
    - All the floors were protected by plastic sheeting.
    - It was the upstairs maisonette and I only came up half way before deciding I didn't want to go up to see him and left.

### Two years later

- Mike's wife emails everyone asking for support because her husband has just murdered a woman. I'm in Lourdes at the time.
- Mike had contacted me a couple of weeks before the murder, out of the blue, and asked me if I wanted to go to an ayahuasca ceremony with him.
- It seems like he might have been hoping to murder me.

### Three years later

![Wenham](../../content/images/wenham.png)

- Details about Mike's extremely sordid case is [published in the tabloids](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/michael-wenham-dad-who-decapitated-5071160).
- Mike, it turned out, appeared to have become homicidal towards women after a botched penis enlargement operation.
- It seems he must have been suffering an exaggerated porn addiction at the time and probably when I worked for him too.
- Is it possible Mike was targeted by the sentiment-manipulators also?

## Cyber-stalking in Dénia

- When the gang stalking peaked, in [March 2024](../2024/march.md), online and at the conservatory and in the streets of Dénia, wherever I went in fact (they had been tracking my movements online for years it turned out), the stalkers and criminal gangs used the above history to try to intimidate and frighten me even more. 
- They knew everything about me, where I was, what I was doing, and they shared my life with the people of Dénia.
- So, now, I'm returning the kindness for God's purposes.
