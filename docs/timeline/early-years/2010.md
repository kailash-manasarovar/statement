## Why I decided to be celibate for the rest of my life

- Even with a PhD in Computer Science, I find it impossible to get a junior position as a female programmer.
- I travel to India in April to get professional Java qualifications.
- In May, I plan on doing some intensive yoga activities.
- I search for a yoga course online.
- The only course that comes up, again and again as the first option in Google search, is [a course in Rishikesh run by a Jitendra Das, PhD in Yoga](https://www.patanjaliyogafoundation.com/).
- There are hundreds of yoga courses and ashrams in Rishikesh. 
- I found it weird and *significant* that only his course came up in Google search.
- I never considered online manipulation; ever. Not once.
- I signed up.
- He wanted students to send photos, which I found weird. I can't remember if I sent one. Maybe.
- Anyway, I quickly found out that Jitendra Das was a sexual pervert.
- Actually, in truth he was a lost soul who had been doing intensive spiritual practices while young for long periods and had made huge progress in yoga.
- However, something made him lose his way and he had clearly become a rampant sex addict with no control of himself at all.
- He targeted me as a *lover*.
- Now, I was not interested but, at that time, I had no boundaries.
- It was not that long after having remembered gang rape and I was still injured emotionally, mentally, and spiritually from the retraumatizing.
- Although I gave a bit of a fight, a man like Jitendra, who had no respect at all for women, just pushed his way in and I seemingly lost any ability to say no.
- We had a lot of sex.
- And all of it was quite unpleasant too.
- Jitendra was rough and unloving, and he obviously despised women.
- I complained about it.
- I told him I didn't want to have sex olympics every darned night.
- He didn't care about what I wanted.
- I told him he was like a farm animal.
- Even so, I found it impossible to say no, and stay in my hotel.
- It was like I was enchanted, bewitched.
- One night, while we slept, I saw a demon-like being lying curled up in his second chakra.
- Like all demons, and all evil, it is weak and pathetic. Sad. It looks ancient; like it has been here for millennia all shriveled up and desperate to cling to life somehow, anyhow, but always in some self-imprisoning way.
- I realized that his addiction, however naively it may have begun, had drawn a spiritual parasite into his energetic field and he was mostly feeding that.
- I saw that he really couldn't help himself and would probably need an exorcism of some sort to have any hope at all of ever being his true self.
- TT might do it. TT brings sufficient resilience so that the client has the strength to step away.
- Yet, he wasn't even aware that he had a problem and a client must want healing.
- Anyway, it was a very unpleasant month with Jitendra and it unbalanced me mentally and emotionally as you might expect, and it took a long time to get over it.
- I thought I was in love with him. 
- I see now that that was a defensive accommodation; the only way I could keep myself safe in such a horrible situation.
- Thank the Lord he didn't love me back; we were totally incompatible in every possible way.
- He was doing very powerful sorcery on me somehow; or maybe he just sought out vulnerable women who had been sexually abused, and he spotted me immediately, or was he told?
- When I realized I was not in love with him, about a year later and after some intense meditative practices, I liberated myself.
- Anyway, that was that ...except...
- Five years later, in 2015 when I was living in Dénia and attending the conservatory, I noticed he was doing courses in Valencia together with a female yoga teacher based there.

[![Jitendra in Valencia](../../content/images/jitendra-in-valencia.png)](https://www.facebook.com/events/799780983439933/)

- Jitendra usually worked with a Ukrainian team who organized trips out to India.
- He had visited Kiev too at some point.
- He told me about a dog in a Kiev street going crazy at him.
- He showed me some professional photos he had done there. 
- There were hundreds of miniature shots of him in various yoga poses wearing tiny red pants; his substantial tackle most obvious.
- I'm guessing he was probably starring in porn somewhere too.
- Would he have been aware of that if he was? Probably not all of it.
- Jitendra told me, again and again, how he was going to set up an orphanage at his new yoga centre that was being built at the time. 
- I shuddered.
- I see now he is offering pregnancy yoga, which is more than concerning.
- I wonder if Jitendra's team was also doing the spy-cam thing back in 2010?
- Am I in even more porn without knowing it?
- If so, was I targeted yet again by the same conspirators with connections in the Valencian region and lured to Jitendra's school by online manipulation?
- My goodness this is getting a bit tiring and ridiculous isn't it.
- One of the most curious things about my experience doing yoga in India that time was a Miss VD Stain (phonetic spelling) who was also a student in the class - I kid you not.
- She was a curiously ugly person, inside and out, and I suspect she was also having sex with Jitendra when she wasn't having sex with someone she'd just met in a cafe.
- A strange thing happened one morning after class when we went for breakfast.
- We were sitting at a table finishing our breakfast. 
- Miss VD Stain got up and a second later the ceiling fan came down on her empty chair.
- It would have killed her if she had been sitting there. She had been a nano-second away from instant death.
- It scratched me slightly on the way down.
- Miss VD Stain made an enormous fuss and drama about that scratch. It was extremely bizarre.
- I remember thinking it was a warning; to me; about her.
- She was also running game on me for Jitendra. 
- I remember one instance of her making a huge drama, tears, wailing, etc., with the intention of getting information out of me, for him I assumed.
- I remember thinking; "This young woman thinks she's in Big Brother!".
- She was rather like Sandra Rita Diaz, in retrospect.
- She most certainly could have been one of the team, and she was certainly ignorant and immature enough to have been delighted to be doing porn.
- Oh I nearly forgot, Jitendra was a total coward, and not very bright, and there was *a lot* of poisoning going on in Rishikesh at that time.

## Mike Wenham

- I'm back in the UK and I get my first job in programming as a junior Java developer for a e-commerce company owned by British Telecom.
- I love the job.
- I'm one of two women in a department of many men.
- The other woman is being bullied, relentlessly. It's ugly.
- I don't know how to help her. It's my first job as a programmer and I want to do well.
- About four months after I start, she walks out.
- The men sing, 'Ding dong the witch is dead'.
- Another man, Peter, walks out in disgust at the same time.
- The bullying reverts to me immediately.
- Porn on my screen. Rape jokes.
- It's relentless and overwhelming.
- I realize I will never advance in a brutal and hostile environment like this, and leave.
- My boss, Mike Wenham, is furious and tries to get me to stay.

!!! info "Two weeks before I hand in my notice"
    - I hand in my notice on the run up to the New Year.
    - Mike was moonlighting as a builder and had an account on one of the builder platforms.
    - Two weeks before I left, Mike had been doing building work in a maisonette in Lesley Road very near to my street in East Finchley, literally the next road.
    - He had asked me to come and see him there one Saturday morning. It must have been December 4th or 11th of 2010.
    - I wasn't sure why he was asking me to pop over, I just thought friendliness.
    - Anyway, I went along and he let me in, or the door was open and he was at the top of the stairs. 
    - He was carrying a stanley knife.
    - All the floors were protected by plastic sheeting.
    - It was the upstairs maisonette and I only came up half way before deciding I didn't want to go up to see him and left.

### Two years later

- Mike's wife emails everyone asking for support because her husband has just murdered a woman. I'm in Lourdes at the time.
- Mike had contacted me a couple of weeks before the murder, out of the blue, and asked me if I wanted to go to an ayahuasca ceremony with him.
- It seems like he might have been hoping to murder me.

### Three years later

![Wenham](../../content/images/wenham.png)

- Details about Mike's extremely sordid case is [published in the tabloids](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/michael-wenham-dad-who-decapitated-5071160).
- Mike, it turned out, appeared to have become homicidal towards women after a botched penis enlargement operation.
- It seems he must have been suffering an exaggerated porn addiction at the time and probably when I worked for him too.
- Is it possible Mike was targeted by the sentiment-manipulators also as part of the [porn fatwa](../early-years/2003.md#porn-fatwa)?

## Christmas with Jitendra

- I had arranged to meet Jitendra in Thailand that Christmas for a few days.
- Curiously, my brother was in Samui at the same time as me.
- The last time I saw my brother before going up to Chiang Mai, he told me he had met this British guy who told him how to get high by buying a certain type of medication at the pharmacy.
- My brother had followed this man's advice, and when he told me about this he was really speeding hard.
- I was worried about him.
- Anyway, I went up to Chiang Mai for a bit and I met someone really nice. A Dutch man. 
- And then… suddenly… my brother went totally AWOL in Samui on these pills, my mother was calling the embassy as no-one could get hold of him, and I had to go rescue him and put him on a flight home.
- So that was that with the Dutchman.
- I wonder if my brother's British drug adviser was the same guy I saw at the Radiance restaurant in December 2024 who looked like the H Samuel’s thief from 1989 … greasy black longish hair with a much younger Mediterranean wife, a man who literally bared his teeth at me.
- Were they tracking my every move back then too?
- Did they know about the Dutchman? 
- Did they have to stop any relationship so I would continue with this ridiculous plan of meeting Jitendra?
- Were they heavily financially invested in Jitendra and making sure everything went to plan?

## Cyber-stalking in Dénia

- When the gang stalking peaked, in [March 2024](../2024/march/1-12.md), online and at the conservatory and in the streets of Dénia, wherever I went in fact (they had been tracking my movements online for years it turned out), the stalkers and criminal gangs used the above history to try to intimidate and frighten me even more. 
- They knew everything about me, where I was, what I was doing, and they shared my life with the people of Dénia.
- So, now, I'm returning the kindness for God's purposes.
