### Hazel Smith

- I meet two women in DÃ©nia via the U3A or similar, Sandra and Hazel Smith, mother and daughter.
- Sandra was the mother. Hazel was the daughter.
- They remind me of two women, a mother and daughter, I had seen in a Channel 4 documentary, aired in the 90s, when I was living in London.
- The documentary told the story of two women who had "befriended" old people with dementia, or who were close to death. The women had somehow managed to get them to change their wills and took all the money when they died.
- Adult children of the victims were telling their stories on the documentary and it was appalling and sickening to learn of this. I was horrified, in fact.
- There was a strong suggestion that their targets had been drugged, and there was even a suggestion of sexual activity with regards to the male victims and the younger woman. 
- The documentary went on to say that they had actually been charged, and the case went to crown court. However, they were found not guilty.
- These two women in Denia were *EXACTLY* like the two on the documentary, even down to the mother's headscarf.
- I went to dinner with them one evening, and I was not surprised to hear constant references to them borrowing money, to suggestions they couldn't pay their bills, to them waiting for me to suggest I would help them out.
- I was silent and I did not mention my suspicion.
- Sandra, the mother, was talking about a "situation" with someone in the community she had borrowed money from and it was all a bit of a drama.
- Hazel was talking about how she was sleeping with a married man, a local Spaniard.
- Everything they said made me more sure they were who I thought they were.
- Hazel invited me to go out for drinks one evening, which I did.
- We went to a club, drunk a fair bit. She found two men and we went back to her house with them.
- Hazel disappeared into the bedroom which one of them, and myself and the other left and went home to our respective houses.
- Hazel invited me for an Indian a few days later and I accepted.
- She told me things over dinner that suggested she used sex with men to get what she wanted.
- She told me she had nearly been married once but backed out at the last minute, but not before she'd got a car out of him.
- She asked me did I like the boy she left me with and the suggestion was in a sexual way. I asked her if was she out of her mind. She was shocked.
- At dinner, I told her that I had recently remembered serious child sexual abuse and that, at that time, my life was all about healing from that.
- She changed at that moment and became weirdly angry and aggressive towards me.
- I figured I had hit a nerve with regards to something similar that may have happened to her as a child.
- We paid, and when we got the change she literally threw it at me in a very unpleasant way.
- She then asked me back to hers for a drink and a smoke.
- I agreed. I did not smoke pot, but I had a few puffs. She explained she was a pot addict.
- She gave me a drink and I started to feel extremely woozy.
- At some point she declared loudly I was to get up from my chair, she was taking me home.
- I dragged myself up, and staggered speechless into her car, with her help, and she drove me to my apartment building. She opened the car door from inside the car and said "get out" loudly.
- I managed to get out of the car and into my flat and into the bathroom.
- I may have vomited.
- I then lay on the cold tile floor completely still, unable to move or speak, for about 6 hours. 
- It was winter and I believe the vomiting and the cold tiles kept me alive.
- I knew that I had been sedated with an extremely strong medication or anaesthetic.
- It was horrifying and overwhelming. I was unable to go to the police about it.
- I made excuses and never saw her again.
- I was 100% sure at that moment that Hazel and Sandra Smith were the two I had seen in the documentary and that they were still active.
- I wondered if having that sort of power over people was addictive maybe.
- It horrified me that Hazel was working as an accountant, and over subsequent years I saw her advertising talks and seminars for the British expat community, via the U3A and similar, as to how to manage their taxes.
- When we had been out drinking, Hazel had talked about her time on P&O cruise ships as the ship's accountant and mentioned one time about how it was a "long way down" if you had fallen from deck on those boats. The implication of her words made me shudder.
