## January

- I go to the Metropolitan police about child sexual abuse I had remembered
- I remember being gang raped by a grooming gang that had targeted me in North London when I was 16
- I was retraumatized by all this

## Meet Hazel and Sandra Smith

- I meet these two in Denia via the U3A or similar probably in November time
- They remind me of two women I had seen in a Channel 4 documentary some time in the 90s when I was living in London
- The documentary was telling the story of two women who had "befriended" old people with dementia, managed to get them to change their wills, and took the money when they died
- Adult children of the victims were telling the story on the documentary, which was appalling
- There was a strong suggestion that the targets had been drugged or sedated, and there was even a suggestion of some kind of sexual activity 
- The documentary explained that they charged with the crime and it went to court. But they got off 
- The two women in Denia were EXACTLY like the two on the documentary I had remembered
- I went to dinner with them and was unsuprised to here constant references to borrowing money, to suggestions they couldn't pay their bills, to waiting for me to suggest I would help them out
- Sandra, the older one, was having some kind of "situation" with someone she had borrowed money from and it was all a bit of a drama
- Hazel invited me to go out for drinks one evening, which I did
- We went to a club, drunk a fair bit, and she found two men and we went back to her house with them
- Hazel disappeared into the bedroom which one of them, and me and the other left and went home to our respective houses
- Hazel invited me for an Indian a few days later and I accepted
- She told me things that suggested she used sex with men to get what she wanted
- She asked me if I had done anything with the other boy. I asked if was she out of her mind. She was shocked
- At dinner I told her I had remembered child sexual abuse and was really dealing with that
- She changed at that moment and became extremely angry and aggressive towards me
- I figured I had hit a nerve with regards to something similar that may have happened to her as a child
- We paid and she literally threw the change at me in a very angry way
- She then asked me back to hers for a drink and a smoke
- I agreed. I did not smoke pot at all but I had a few puffs. She explained she was a pot addict
- She gave me a drink and I started to feel extremely woozy
- At some point she declared I was to get up she was taking me home
- I staggered speechless into the car somehow with her help and she drove me to my door, opened it and said get out loudly
- I managed to get into my flat and into the bathroom
- I think I vomited
- I then lay on the cold tile floor completely still, unable to move or speak, for about 6 hours
- I had been sedated with something extremely strong
- It was horrifying
- I made excuses and never saw her again
- I was 100% sure at that moment that Hazel and Sandra Smith were the two I had seen in the documentary and they were still drugging people.
- I wondered if it was addictive maybe
- It horrified me that Hazel was working as an accountant and over the years I saw her doing talks and seminars for the British expat community as to how to manage their taxes
- When we had been out, and drinking, Hazel had talked about her time on P&O cruise ships as the ship's accountant and mentioned one time how it was a "long way down" if you had fallen from deck on those boats. Her words made me shudder
