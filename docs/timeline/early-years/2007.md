### Hazel Smith

- I meet two women in Dénia via the U3A or similar, Sandra and Hazel Smith, mother and daughter.
- Sandra was the mother. Hazel was the daughter.
- They remind me of two women, a mother and daughter, I had seen in a Channel 4 documentary, aired in the 90s, when I was living in London.
- The documentary told the story of a mother and daughter who "befriended" old people with dementia, or who were close to death. The women somehow managed to get them to change their wills and took all their money when they died.
- Adult children of the victims were telling their stories on the documentary and it was appalling and sickening to learn of this. I was horrified, in fact.
- There was a strong suggestion that their targets had been drugged, and there was even a suggestion of sexual activity with regards to the male victims and the younger woman. 
- The documentary went on to say that they had actually been charged, and the case went to crown court. However, they were found not guilty.
- These two women in Dénia were *EXACTLY* like the two on the documentary, even down to the mother's headscarf.
- I went to dinner with them one evening, and I was not surprised to hear constant references to them borrowing money, to suggestions they couldn't pay their bills, to them waiting for me to suggest I would help them out.
- I was silent and I did not mention my suspicions.
- Sandra, the mother, was involved in a "situation" with someone in the community she had borrowed money from and it was all a bit of a drama.
- Hazel was talking about how she was sleeping with a married man, a local Spaniard.
- Everything they said made me more sure they were who I thought they were.
- Hazel invited me to go out for drinks one Saturday night, which I did.
- We went to a club and drunk a fair bit of alcohol. She found two men and we went back to her house with them.
- Hazel Smith at that time lived in the Rosaleda II urbanization in the Las Marinas area of Dénia. Currently, a German friend of mine Alessandra, and her British partner John also live there.
- Hazel disappeared into the bedroom with one of the young men, and myself and the other fellow left and walked home to our respective houses.
- Hazel invited me for an Indian a few days later and I accepted.
- She told me things over dinner that suggested she used sex with men to get what she wanted.
- She told me she had nearly been married once but backed out at the last minute, but not before she'd got a car out of him.
- She asked me did I like the boy she left me with and the suggestion was in a sexual way. I asked her if was she out of her mind. She was shocked.
- I then told her that I had recently remembered serious child sexual abuse and that, at that time, my life was all about healing from that.
- Her demeanor changed at that moment and she became weirdly angry and aggressive towards me.
- I figured I had hit a nerve with regards to something similar that may have happened to her as a child.
- We paid, and when the waiter brought the change, she threw it at me in a very unpleasant way, sort of disgusted!
- She then asked me back to hers for a drink and a smoke.
- I agreed. I did not smoke pot, but I had a few puffs. She explained she was a pot addict.
- She gave me a drink and soon after I started to feel extremely woozy and heavy.
- At some point she declared loudly I was to get up from my chair, she was taking me home.
- I dragged myself up, and staggered speechless into her car, with her help, and she drove me to my apartment building. She leaned over me to open the car door from inside the car and told me to "get out" loudly.
- I managed to get out of the car and into my flat and into the bathroom.
- I may have vomited.
- I then lay on the cold tile floor, completely still, unable to move or speak, for about 6 hours. 
- It was winter and I believe the vomiting and the cold tiles kept me alive.
- I knew that I had been sedated with an extremely strong medication or anaesthetic.
- It was horrifying and overwhelming. I was unable to go to the police about it.
- I made excuses in an email, pretending I was concerned about how much I was drinking, and I never saw her again.
- I was 100% sure at that moment that Hazel and Sandra Smith were the two I had seen in the documentary and that they were still active.
- I wondered if having that sort of power over people was addictive.
- It horrified me that Hazel was working as an accountant, and over subsequent years I saw her advertising talks and seminars for the British expat community, via the U3A and similar, on things like how to manage taxes. 
- She offered her financial services directly to the expat community which made me shudder.
- When we had been out drinking, Hazel had talked about her time on P&O cruise ships as the ship's accountant and mentioned one time about how it was a "long way down" if you had fallen from deck on those boats. The implication of her words made me shudder.

!!! info "Why am I telling you all this?"
    - There is so much sedating and poisoning in Dénia, it seems there must be a connection.
    - In September 2023, when I returned to continue my studies after having been severely terrorized by teachers and staff at the conservatory, the gang stalking got exponentially worse.
    - The online stalking, specifically, became intense and overwhelming. It was a mix of sexual grooming, hypnosis, NLP suggestion techniques, and threats of violence and murder.
    - Them drugging me without my knowledge also became more intense and matched the online content I was seeing. I can see this now in retrospect.
    - I believe Hazel Smith was somehow involved.
    - Certainly the stalkers/hackers mentioned her many times in our bizarre exchanges, and they even created a fake Twitter account with an AI generated profile photo which looks to be a mix of mine and Hazel Smith's face. Note the name.

!!! danger "Crime alert"
    - Drugging people without their knowledge is a crime.
    - Drugging people and causing them serious injury by doing so is a crime.
