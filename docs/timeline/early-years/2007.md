## Javea Computer Club

- Around this time I join the [Javea Computer Club](https://javeacomputerclub.com/). I am introduced to Christine, the chair at the time, by a member of the U3A.
- Christine and I become friends and she is very supportive of my PhD efforts.
- The club is extremely busy in the years I visit, 2007-9, and 2012-13.
- It is now not so busy.
- At some point in 2008, I believe, Christine insisted I borrow one of their computers. I had no need for it at all but she pushed it on me. I wonder why now. I borrowed it for a while and returned it. I often walked around naked in my flat in front of it. I wonder if there was a camera inside. I was only on a 56k modem at that time so I can't imagine they would be live streaming. 
- I wonder if the JCC is another central point where incoming expats to the region are assessed for targeting, i.e. how much money they have, if they are sensitive or vulnerable, etc. 
- The reason I wonder about this is because my "friend" Christine pretended she knew nothing about what was going on in 2022-24 but, in fact, everyone knew. She threw me to the wolves.
- I think I might vomit if I ever see her again.
