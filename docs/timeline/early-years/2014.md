## March to July

- I move from Dénia at the end of March to live in Lourdes, France, to volunteer at the baths and to write a novel, 'Life Without The Liar' under a pseudonym, Margaret Murphy.

[![Life without the liar](../../content/images/life-without-the-liar.png){width=50%}](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Without-Liar-Margaret-Murphy-ebook/dp/B00M0CZN94/)

- I feel like my time in Lourdes inspires every chapter; as if Mary is guiding my attempt to heal the horrific experiences of child sexual abuse and London rape gangs from thirty years previous, experiences which statistically are likely to destroy a person (see some [ACE study data](https://www.cdc.gov/aces/about/index.html) for more info) but, for some reason, I survived.
- I bring my piano keyboard with me so I can practice for the audition at the conservatory.
- I study for the written exam and the sight singing, and I practice my keyboard every day.

### Sandra Rita Diaz

- A woman called Sandra Rita Diaz attends the volunteer's course at Lourdes at the same time as me. 
- She is Portuguese and lives in Paris, and is a translator for the police and other social services in France.
- She is a member of the Hospitalite de Lourdes, and she is in the system.
- We become friends and I mention her throughout the story, especially during the three years or so that I was drugged and cyber-stalked.
- I'm never quite sure if I can trust her. Something's off, but I'm not sure what. 
- She presents as a ditzy blond, always late, giggly, etc, but every now and then [the mask slips](../2023/december.md#sandra-rita-diaz) and someone very calculating appears for a nanosecond.
- Over the years I know her, every now and then she will say or do something extremely out of character and I wonder if this is to gauge a reaction.
- Is she part of the conspiracy? If so, it seems that whatever abuse I suffered as a child, which was filmed, must have generated a lot of interest, and made a lot of money for criminals. Thoughts like these make me feel quite unwell.
- The timing of our meeting suggests she could be part of the conspiracy. I'm about to enter the conservatory where some horror is supposed to await me.
- Like the online stalkers and others, she always pretended to be seriously concerned about what was happening to me, but when pressed for a bit of real support, became utterly disinterested and dismissive.
- A gang stalker's interest in a target is superficial. They're just doing what they're told. They don't really care. When normal concern is required from them, they deflect and ignore. They have better things to do, and lives to live. It's just a job for them. They are getting some reward for their behavior of course; you can be sure of that.
- Stalkers and manipulators use common destabilizing and gaslighting tactics and language and Sandra Rita Diaz was no exception.
- Perhaps Sandra is not her real name. I would not be surprised. Sandra is a common gang pseudonym. I expect it signifies the person taking the role of throwing "sand" in the eyes of targets.

### Men in dresses at Lourdes

- During my time volunteering in Lourdes, there were a number of times I noticed men pretending to be women and accessing areas in which women and girls were in vulnerable state of undress.
- A pilgrimage from Glasgow had two of these men: One calling himself Mary worked in one of the bath teams with me one afternoon. An Italian woman was furious but no-one else seemed to notice.
- Another man calling himself Mary, from the same Scottish pilgrimage, was volunteering at the emergency medical station.
- I noticed these things well, but had no context around them so I did not know how to respond to them, and they didn't seem important until closer to the time of writing this police statement.

## April

- I formally apply by post to the [conservatory of Dénia](https://portal.edu.gva.es/conservatoridenia/es/inici/) to join the first year of professional studies for piano.

### Earthquake

- On 29th April, there is an earthquake.
- It wakes me up.
- It feels like a train going through my bedroom.
- Everything shook and rattled and juddered up-and-down.
- It was so noisy too.
- I realized at that moment why the paintings were nailed onto the wall rather than hung.
- The painting in my room was a view of the Viscos.
- It reminded me of the Last Supper, for some reason.
- I even told someone that, who may remember.

![Viscos](../../content/images/viscos.jpg)

- You can see the Viscos mountain from Lourdes High Street as you drive down towards the Post Office from the direction of the train station.
- On a clear day the view can be quite startling.
- I climbed it [in 2023](../2023/august.md) and [in 2024](../2024/august.md) when I was suffering an extended crucifixion of some variety.
- Perhaps that's why the picture reminded me of the Last Supper.
- At the time of writing, in 2025, I can serendipitously see the Viscos peak from my chair; and the cross outside my building is aligned with the mountain.
- There are no thunderstorms at the moment so I've no idea where [the lightning came from](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W92R2v8QAsAzDaAs1oIg99ozWLrcuqJ4/view?usp=drive_link).

## May

- I receive the [receipt of my application from the Generalitat](../../content/documents/papeles-conservatorio/justificante-may-2014.pdf).

## June

### Conservatory audition

- I travel back to Dénia from Lourdes to take the exam.
- Domingo the piano teacher is there, in the background. It's the first time I meet him.
- He makes a point of introducing himself to me and chatting a little.
- His English is very good.
- I find him a bit weird, odd looking, pale; unwell maybe but polite and charming.

## September

### Studies begin

- I start the first year of professional piano studies at Dénia conservatory.
- Domingo is going to be my piano teacher. It has been arranged.
- I have no problem with this.
- Domingo is a muscle-man-type and looks like he may have been taking testosterone and similar. 

### Finding a flat

- I had problems finding a flat in Dénia so I reached out to my old landlady in Madrid who told me the flat I had previously lived in was available
- It was in a terrible mess when I arrived and there was a toxic smell.
- I cleaned the whole house, but I continued to smell something weird, so I started looking for better accommodation and left.
- I found a flat nearby but there was a chain-smoker next door and poor ventilation.

### First piano class at the end end of September

- Domingo asks if I want to go for coffee after class, I decline.
- I'm staying at the Hotel Costa Blanca in Dénia.
- I get really sick after class, flu-like symptoms. 
- As well as that, I become deliriously upset about something, and I phone home ranting, two or three times, on the night I get sick.
- I'm better the next day and I don't understand what happened.
- I felt like I was spiked with drugs it was so out of the ordinary.
- When I'm better, I forget about it.

## October

### Second piano class

- Domingo asks if I want to go for coffee.
- I decline.

### Third piano class 

- Domingo asks if I want to go for coffee.
- Slightly warn down, I agree.
- We go for coffee.
- I find Domingo to be sexist and disagreeable.
- He talks about his ex-girlfriend who left him for another man who she now has a baby with.
- She's German and he visited her family in Germany, he tells me.
- It's not clear why they split up.
- We go for lunch and for dinner on different occasions.
- The dinner is at the Japanese restaurant and we are sitting at a table with two other couples. Domingo behaves in a loud and obnoxious manner. I find him a little embarrassing. I feel like he knows the people at dinner, as they do not respond normally to his very weird and loud performances.
- I find out he has a problem with food, something like bulimia.
- He keeps telling me, loudly, about how I'm too old. You're so old, he says repeatedly. I find it offensive and weird given he is only a couple of years younger than me.

!!! important
    - I now believe Domingo's references to my age were with regards to me not being so *porn-ready*, and/or how unlikely it was for me to be sold on to a friend for breeding purposes.
    - It turns out Domingo is probably gay and his references were likely more to do with how good a 'product' I was.

### Consequent piano classes

- We become friends, even though I don't like him particularly.

!!! tip "Domingo tells me he used to sing with the Orfeo de Dénia"
    - During our chats, Domingo tells me he used to sing in the choir I sing in.
    - Domingo and Klari have been associates for many years.
    - Klari had also told me she knew Domingo.
    - I wonder if he met his German girlfriend at the choir. I should have asked him.
    - Klari will know.

- I don't feel unsafe with him. There is not that feeling of a man wanting to have sex with me, which always used to make me nervous and apprehensive. I felt more like I would feel if I was with a gay man, but I don't register this consciously at the time.
- He starts love bombing me while at the same time saying offensive and extremely sexist things; women shouldn't be in politics, women are terrible drivers, etc.
- He tells me he is seeing a therapist for something he doesn't disclose but I guess it's bulimia and maybe relationships.
- He plays mind games with me and other women, including the yoga teacher Natalia. He shows me pictures he has taken of her doing yoga poses. It's not clear if she's aware she's being photographed.
- It seems like he is trying to make me jealous, which is ridiculous.
- I find him immature and sexist. I'm thoroughly unimpressed with him.
- He often mentions funeral marches in our discussions about music and my repertoire. Oh we will be doing a funeral march, he says, often. I think he is taking the piss and disregard it.
- Domingo came to the toxic-smelling flat to see the piano I had bought. (The piano had been available for sale for 150 euros at the storage facility I had my stuff in when I moved back from Lourdes.) On the walk there, we went through the tunnel under the castle, and when we were on the other side, Domingo mentioned how the gypsies lived in that area. 
- He said it in a kind of fearful way. I wondered why.
- Suddenly, a flat came up somewhere else. It was the only available rental. It had previously been really easy to find a flat to rent in Dénia. Now, not at all. I surmise it is because of the rise of AirBnB-type holiday accommodation.
- The apartment wasn't ideal; there was no parking and a big hole in the frontroom window, but I had no other options so I moved in. The address was Avenida Joan Fuster, 11, 3rd floor, the one bedroom flat facing the road at the far end.
- Domingo was very interested in my house hunting and had a lot of advice to give me on it.

## November

### Invitation to Lourdes

- One evening, Domingo and I are walking through the town after classes.
- I tell him I'm visiting Lourdes at Christmas, and ask him if he would like to join me.
- He says nothing.

### Domingo comes for tea

- Domingo visits my house for tea one Sunday evening.
- He tells me he approves of my kitchen.
- We have tea and biscuits and a (I thought) nice chat.
- He leaves.
- On the way out he puts a large chewed-up bolus of the biscuits I offered him into one of my boots at the door.
- I find this when I go to put my boot on the following day.
- He had pretended to eat two biscuits, gone to the toilet and retrieved them - possibly by vomiting them up. He had kept them in his pocket for another hour and put them in my boot on his way out the door. I guess you might do this sort of thing to someone you intend to terrorize. 

!!! danger "Another theory"
    - Could Domingo have been "performing" for the audience of people who were watching me in my apartment via spy-cams?

### I visit Domingo's house

- Domingo makes soup for me.
- He serves the soup into two dishes, and gives me the broken dish.
- I take the broken dish and start to eat.
- He looks at his dish, and suddenly says he's not hungry anymore and doesn't eat.

!!! danger "Interesting"
    - Domingo lived in a rented flat at that time; an apartment on an upper floor at Plaza de Jorge Juan.

    ![Plaza de Jorge Juan](../../content/images/domingos-old-address.png)

    - It seemed like a rather big flat for just him but apparently his ex-girlfriend had moved out recently, although she was already married to someone else and they had a baby.
    - It seems to me now that Domingo would not have stayed alone in an expensive apartment for a long period. He was a rather stingy person and the rent was very high.
    - He told me his  landlord was a British expat, a pensioner. 
    - The landlord had left the Royal Dalton tableware in the flat; the correct spelling is Doulton, I only knew it phonetically until I looked it up.
    - It turns out that Royal Doulton tableware is rather valuable. I didn't know this until recently and it begs the question, why did the landlord leave his very valuable tableware in the apartment? 
    - Domingo kept going on about the Royal Doulton tableware as if it was important to him. 
    - He suggested at one point he was going to take the tableware with him when he left the flat. 
    - I thought this was extremely low behavior, theft in fact.
    - I now wonder why he thought this seemed like a reasonable thing for him to do.

### Sexualized comments about schoolgirls

- On one occasion we are having coffee at a bar in the Marquis de Campo and a group of schoolgirls walk past in their school uniforms.
- They are probably no more than 14 years old.
- Domingo says sexualizing things about them; things you might imagine a man in the 1960s would say about 14 year old girls in school uniforms.
- I am appalled.

### A conservatory trip

- There is going to be a trip to Paris or similar for the children of the conservatory.
- Domingo suggests I come along as one of the guardians.
- He mentions something that makes my ears prick up which is in reference to looking after the girls at night while we're away.
- There's something not right about what he's saying and I relate it to his views on schoolgirls generally.

### He gets to me

- It's not clear how because he's so offensive but the love bombing is working.
- I find myself becoming a bit obsessed with him.
- But I'm ambivalent.
- It's difficult to know what to do because he is my piano teacher and I have to see him every week at the conservatory.
- He has pushed his way into my life rather forcefully and I don't particularly like him.
- However, he is using love bombing tactics on me which are making me obsess over him. In retrospect I wonder if he is doing this via social media NLP/MRA seduction techniques, i.e. hypnosis.
- I invite him to London as I am going anyway and I would like the company. I have found home very difficult over previous years due to the relationship with my brother breaking down.

!!! danger "In retrospect"
    - I wonder now if I was being medicated with some aphrodisiac-type substance at that time, just as I have been more recently.
    - The feelings I had then match exactly how I have been feeling in recent years in Dénia with regards to the trumpet teacher, albeit slightly less so.

## December

### Trip to London

- Domingo (apparently) lies to the conservatory about being unwell so he can go to London with me.
- It is Friday 5th December in the early morning. Domingo texts me and tells me to get into the car already and wait for him, and that he's coming.
- So I leave my house and get into the car to wait.
- It's an extremely cold morning and misty too.
- As I'm waiting, I see my friend Zoe walking into town in hot pants from Las Rotas. 
- I think it's strange.
- Domingo appears at the car door just after.

!!! danger "In retrospect"
    - I realize that this was another set up.
    - I was supposed to see Zoe that morning and I believe it was for some future purpose intended for me (which never transpired) where I would “realize with a shock” that everything that had happened was planned.
    - What is in Las Rotas that Zoe might be coming home from in hot pants at 7am in the freezing cold?
    - Is it the swingers club? Or the little stone house where they make porn that the English ladies told me about?
    - Was the intention that I would have ended up there someday without being able to say no for some horrible reason, and then realizing it was all set up from even before it seemed to be?
    - I guess that’s it. They’re consistent at least.

- We set off in my car to Valencia airport and take a flight together.
- Going through security, Domingo tells me he used to dance naked (or nearly so) at a nightclub in Gandia.
- I tell Domingo that when I was young I used to go raving and take ecstasy.
- At that moment, Domingo's attitude changes towards me.
- At the boarding gate, Domingo flirts outrageously with a woman from the airline and I'm offended.
- Throughout the trip, Domingo is rude and obnoxious, flirting with women constantly, and I'm so appalled at his behavior I realize I want nothing to do with him.
- I tell him I think he's an ape.
- I am disgusted with him.
- I realize in 2024 that the purpose of his trip is to check out how much money my family has and he was totally uninterested in friendship of any sort. In fact, he despised me.

### End of term concert

- I play two Chopin preludes:
    - [Op 28 No 9](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdEjIT6wYP62wPAf3NXEiQuy7iz2QVil/view?usp=drive_link)
    - [Op 28 No 10](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wK_r4XZAufrCyfzHe0HdXdQki_lRAlgS/view?usp=drive_link)

### Poisoned aunts

- Domingo is upset with me and we have a breakdown in amicable communication. However, he is still my piano teacher.
- I start to feel anxious and my mind starts racing with concerns about him.
- *He threatens to poison me*: He tells me a story about a woman his uncle was with (I always assumed an aunt) who tried to leave, and then he described how this woman turned yellow over some months, with big black circles under her eyes, how she got really sick, and her hair fell out.
- I understood this to be an unequivocal threat of violence, and I realized I needed to be as far away from this man as possible.
- Domingo tells me I'm frigid, and I hear him telling the other teachers the same thing, very loudly, in the corridors at the conservatory.
- At the Christmas choir concert, a woman arrives for rehearsal, two hours before the show, and sits in the middle of the auditorium seating and glares at me. I'm sure it's Domingo's mother. The woman looks exactly like him.
- I never met any of his family, even though he visited my family home for a weekend, although he did tell me he had a sister Carmen who was in Valencia at the time.

!!! tip "Online sources"
    - Online sources suggest this uncle of Domingo's may be called Jose.
    - Furthermore, everyone will know *exactly* who this Jose is.
    - Could this person be the threatening man from [Halloween 2023](../2023/october.md#halloween)?

### At the conservatory

- Although our relationship has broken down, he is still my piano teacher.
- One day, Domingo says to me loudly at class, "I know who you can be with".
- Suddenly, another teacher, Nacho the clarinet teacher, is always around looking weird. He looks a bit like Brian Ferry.

!!! tip
    - When I say "always around", it's like he's always there when I am; planned, choreographed, and contrived.

- I realize Domingo's intention is to set me up with this guy.
- I feel quite sick. The implication is that Domingo owns me and will continue to control what goes on my life. I wonder how he could possibly feel this way about random women he hardly knows.
- It doesn't occur to me, at that time, that Domingo believes he owns all the women and girls in his life and it is his prerogative to use and manipulate them all, and quite likely find ways to make money from them too.

!!! tip "Tweets from more recently"
    - The Bryan Ferry character becomes extremely aggressive in more recent years, following me around town for example. I tweet about him a few times.
    - https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1707151247059321125
    - This tweet was in reply to something very obviously related to the intense gang-stalking I was suffering at the conservatory at that time. 
    - School teachers should not engage in gang-stalking and terrorizing students.
    - One wonders how many students have been targeted in this way by teachers and staff at the conservatory of Dénia, and for what purpose. Psychopathic fun? Or something more sinister?
