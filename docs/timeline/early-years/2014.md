## April

### Apply to conservatory

- With Mercedes help I apply to the conservatory.
- I am also helping her husband, Miguel Angel, who wants conversational English classes.

## June

### Do the audicion

- I pass it
- Domingo Cano Lopez is there, in the background
- He makes a point of meeting me to talk and introduce himself
- His English is very good
- I find him a bit weird, odd looking, unwell maybe

## September

### Start studies

- I start the first year of professional piano studies at Dénia conservatory
- Domingo is going to be my piano teacher

### First class end of September

- Domingo asks if I want to go for coffee after class, I decline
- I get really sick after class, the flu, I'm staying at a hotel in Dénia
- But I'm also deliriously upset about something, and I phone home ranting, two or three times
- I'm better the next day and don't understand what happened
- I feel like I was spiked

### Finding a flat

- I had problems finding a flat in Dénia so I reached out to an old landlady in Madrid who told me the flat I had previously lived in was available
- It was in a terrible mess when I arrived and there was a toxic smell
- I cleaned the whole house up, but I continued to smell something weird, so I started looking for somewhere and left
- I found a flat nearby but there was a chainsmoker next door and poor ventilation
- Domingo came to the flat to see the piano I had bought (it had been available for sale at the storage facility I had my stuff in for 150 euros!). On the walk there, we went under the tunnel, and Domingo mentioned how the gypsies lived in that area. I wondered why that was important
- Suddenly, a flat came up somewhere else, it was the only one available, it wasn't ideal, but I had no choice so I moved in

## October

### Second class

- Domingo asks if I want to go for coffee
- I decline

### Third class 

- Domingo asks if I want to go for coffee
- Slightly warn down, I agree
- We go for coffee
- I find Domingo sexist and disagreeable
- He talks about his ex-girlfriend who left him for another man who she now has a baby with
- She's German and he visited her family in Germany
- It's not clear why they split up

### Consequent classes

- We become friends, even though I don't like him particularly
- He starts love bombing me while saying offensive and extremely sexist things like women shouldn't be in politics, women are terrible drivers, etc.

## November

### Domingo comes for tea

- Domingo visits my house for tea one Sunday evening after I invited him
- He tells me he approves of my kitchen
- We have tea
- He leaves
- On the way out he puts the chewed up biscuits I offered him and he accepted into my boot at the door
- I find this when I go to put my boot on the following day

### I visit Domingo's house

- Domingo makes soup for me
- He gives me the broken dish

### Comments about school girls

- On one ocassion we are having coffee and a group of schoolgirls walk past in their school uniforms
- They are probably 14
- Domingo says sexualizing things about them, like you might imagine a man in the 1960s would say about 14 year old girls in school uniforms
- I am appalled

### He gets to me

- It's not clear how because he's so offensive but the love bombing is working
- I find myself becoming a bit obsessed with him
- But I'm ambivalent 
- It's difficult to know what to do because he is my piano teacher
- I invite him to London as I am going and I would like the company
- I have found home very difficult over previous years due to the relationship with my brother breaking down

## December

### Trip to London

- Domingo lies to the conservatory about being unwell so he can skip a working day to go to London with me
- We set off in my car to Valencia airport and take a flight together
- Going through security, Domingo tells me he used to dance naked (or nearly so) at a nightclub in Gandia
- I tell Domingo that when I was young I used to go raving and take ecstasy
- At that moment, Domingo's attitude changes towards me
- At the boarding gate, Domingo flirts outrageously with a woman from the airline and I'm offended
- Throughout the trip, Domingo is rude and obnoxious, flirting with women constantly and I'm so appalled at his behavior I realize I want nothing to do with him
- I tell him I think he's an ape
- I am disgusted with him

### Back in Dénia

- Domingo is upset with me and we have a breakdown in amicable communication
- I start to feel anxious and my mind is racing a lot with concerns about him
- He threatens to poison me ... he tells me a story of a woman his uncle was with who tried to leave him, and then he described how this woman turned yellow over months, big bags under her eyes, got really sick, and her hair was falling out
- I understood this as a threat and realised I needed to be as far away from this man as possible
- Domingo tells me I'm frigid, and I hear him telling the other teachers the same very loudly in the corridors at the conservatory
- At the choir concert, a woman arrives for rehearsal, 2 hours before the show, and sits in the middle of the auditorium seating and glares at me. I'm sure it's Domingo's mother
- I never met any of his family although he told me he had a sister Carmen
