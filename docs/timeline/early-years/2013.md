## Meeting Mercedes

- I met Mercedes Correas Lara, a woman in her 60s from Madrid, at the Dénia International choir.
- I had been attending twice a week.
- The choir master then and today is Klara Sarkadi.
- At some point, I believe it was on a choir trip, Mercedes starts telling me about how she is planning to study the piano at the conservatory.
- She says she had studied piano when she was younger to a fairly high standard.
- The conservatory of Dénia is a public-funded music school. The students are mostly children and teenagers (minors), and a small number of adults, who study a range of instruments from beginners to advanced levels.
- I studied music for my first degree in 1991-1994 and I have played the piano since I was 5.
- I haven't played for 20 years and I would love to play again. 
- Mercedes promises to help me prepare for the entrance exam, which is complicated.
- We plan to apply for the next intake, 2014-15, for the first year of professional studies.
- We study together a bit for the exam. 
- She manages to get hold of the entrance exam paper which I can revise from.
- With Mercedes help, I can apply to the conservatory.
- I am also helping her husband, Miguel Angel, who wants conversational English classes and I have been going to their house once-a-week to do that.
