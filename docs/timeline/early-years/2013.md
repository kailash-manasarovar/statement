## Meet Mercedes at choir

- Mercedes was a woman from Madrid in her 60s who I met at the Denia International choir 
- The choir master is Klara Sarkadi
- Mercedes starts talking about studying piano at the conservatory
- The Denia conservatory is a music school for mainly minors, and a small number of adults to study instruments from beginners to advanced levels
- I have a background in piano, I haven't played for years, I'm good, and I'm interested
- Mercedes promises to help me prepare for the entrance exam which is complicated, and totally in Valenciano/Castellano
