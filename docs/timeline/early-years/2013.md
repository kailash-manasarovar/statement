## The gays leave suddenly

- I am living in Dénia in the Passeig Periodista Ramon Ortega apartment block.
- I invite friends for dinner: Margaret Cornwell who I met at the U3A, a British pensioner, and a gay couple who are ostensibly her friends rather than mine.
- David is an English teacher who was working previously at the Javea school and his husband, ?, is an anaesthetist at the local Dénia hospital.
- The husband is angry that night, very angry. It's not really clear why.
- They are moving from Dénia back to the UK. It is very hurried. I wonder if that is why the husband is so angry.
- In one of his rants, he mentioned Hazel Smith and alcoholism, and I wonder why.

!!! info "Why is this important?"
    - My story includes many instances of voyeurism, secret camera footage, and online hacking of laptop/phone cameras, in Dénia and beyond.
    - As I was collating all the information related to what happened to me, it seemed sensible to wonder if it was related to what happened to make the gay couple up and leave so quickly, and be so angry and resentful about it.
    - It was curious that he mentioned Hazel, and especially in relation to alcoholism, which was the story I had used to (apparently) detach myself from her.
    - Does she live in their house now?

!!! danger "In retrospect"
    - I now wonder if Hazel and Sandra Smith got their hands on my friend Margaret Cornwell.
    - Not long after this meeting I don't see her for a while, she's unwell.
    - When I meet her, she says she's feeling better but she looked very frail. She was in her 80s at that time.
    - Curiously whenever I asked anyone about Margaret, they said they didn't know her, even people that volunteered with the Help charity which Margaret and I used to volunteer for together.
    - While we're at it, how about Anne and Pete Holden, other pensioner friends of mine from Denia. Their name is still on their flat postbox. Enric told me they had gone back home but I can't find any information about them anywhere and everyone, including the Javea Computer Club members, said they didn't know them. They lived on Avenida de Alcoi.

## Meeting Porsche

- I met Porsche Correas Lara, a woman in her 60s from Madrid, at the Dénia International choir.
- I had been attending the choir twice a week.
- The choir master then, and today, is Klara Sarkadi.
- At some point, I believe it was on a choir trip, Porsche starts telling me about how she is planning to study the piano at the conservatory.
- She says she had studied piano when she was younger to a fairly high standard.
- The [conservatory of Dénia](https://portal.edu.gva.es/conservatoridenia/) is a public-funded music school. The students are mostly children and teenagers (minors), and a small number of adults, who study a range of instruments from beginner to advanced levels.
- I studied music for my first degree in 1991-1994 and I have played the piano since I was 5.
- I hadn't played for 20 years at that time and I really wanted to play again. 
- Porsche promised to help me prepare for the entrance exam, which is complicated.
- We plan to apply for the next intake, 2014-15, for the first year of professional piano studies.
- We study together a bit for the exam. 
- She manages to get hold of the entrance exam paper which I can revise from.
