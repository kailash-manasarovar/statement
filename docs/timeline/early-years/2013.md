## The gays leave suddenly

- I am living in Dénia in the Passeig Periodista Ramon Ortega apartment block.
- I invite friends over for dinner: Mags who I met at the U3A, a British pensioner, and a gay couple who are ostensibly her friends rather than mine.
- Dandy is an English teacher who was working previously at the Javea school. I have completely forgotten the husband's name unfortunately, but he is an anaesthetist at the local Dénia hospital.
- The husband is angry that night, very angry. It's not really clear why but he keeps alluding to things.
- They are moving from Dénia back to the UK. It is very hurried. I wonder if that is why the husband is so angry.
- In one of his angry rants, he mentions Hazel Smith, and alcoholism. I wonder why.

!!! info "Why did the anaethetist mention Hazel?"
    - This story includes many instances of voyeurism, secret camera footage, and the online hacking of laptop/phone cameras in Dénia and beyond.
    - As I was collating the information related to what happened to me, including the possibility I had been targeted for blackmail with sex tapes, it seemed sensible to wonder if what made the gay couple up and leave so quickly, and be so angry and resentful about it, could be related.
    - It was curious that he mentioned Hazel, and especially in relation to alcoholism, which was the story I had used to (apparently) detach myself from her.
    - I have a vague memory of the anaethestist saying, furiously, something like, "she just took the keys!"
    - Does Hazel live in their old house now?

!!! danger "In retrospect"
    - I now wonder if Hazel and Sandra Smith got their hands on my friend Mags; a female pensioner living alone, a sitting duck maybe.
    - I didn't see Mags for a while after the dinner, and when I finally went round to her house, she looked really unwell, dishevelled, whiter-haired, older. She told me she'd had a spell of despond but was feeling better.
    - Mags, a woman in her 80s, and disabled, was robust and strong, so I was shocked to see her looking so frail. 
    - Curiously, whenever I asked any of my British friends about Mags over more recent years (2022-24), everyone said they didn't know her, even people that had been very involved with the [Help charity](https://helpmarinaalta.org/). 
    - Mags and I used to volunteer at Dénia hospital as a volunteer pair. We really enjoyed it.
    - While we're at it, how about Alf & Petra, other pensioner friends of mine from Dénia. Their name label is still on their flat postbox on the Avenida de Alcoi. They had been very active in the Moors & Christians fiestas.
    - [Enric](2008.md#enric) told me A&P had gone back home to the UK but I can't find any information about them anywhere. Strangely, like with Mags, everyone, including the [Javea Computer Club](2007.md#javea-computer-club) member list manager, said they didn't know them when I asked after them, and they had been members of the JCC for a good few years. 

## Meeting Porsche

- I met Porsche, a woman in her 60s from Madrid, at the Dénia International choir.
- I had been attending the choir twice a week.
- The choir master then, and today, is Klara Sarkadi.
- At some point, I believe it was on a choir trip, Porsche starts telling me about how she is planning to study the piano at the conservatory.
- She says she had studied piano when she was younger to a fairly high standard.
- The [conservatory of Dénia](https://portal.edu.gva.es/conservatoridenia/) is a public-funded music school. The students are mostly children and teenagers (minors), and a small number of adults, who study a range of instruments from beginner to advanced levels.
- I studied music for my first degree in 1991-1994 and I have played the piano since I was 5.
- I hadn't played for 20 years at that time and I really wanted to play again. 
- Porsche promised to help me prepare for the entrance exam, which isn't easy, and even more complicated for people who don't understand Valenciano.
- We plan to apply for the next intake, 2014-15, for the first year of professional piano studies.
- We study together for the exam. 
- She manages to get hold of the entrance exam paper which I can revise from.
- I never question her motives.
