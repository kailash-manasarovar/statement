## A Course In Miracles

- I never saw Hazel Smith again apart from that one time, fleetingly, and [outside the conservatory in 2023](../2023/october.md#hazel-outside-the-conservatory) but I did see her mother Sandra a couple of times.
- On one occasion she picked me up from outside my house and we drove over to Javea to attend a kind of "spiritual" event where there were two speakers, a psychic from Bulgaria, and Trudy, a Dutch yoga teacher who was giving a talk about A Course In Miracles.
- The psychic was extremely giggly and silly, and I was not impressed by her. She found me equally unappealing due to my suspicious attitude towards her and was a little violent towards me.
- The talk that Trudy gave about A Course In Miracles blew my mind.
- As she began to describe what the book was about, the room erupted.
- Holy war kicked off fiery arguments and debates about God and religion. People were getting offended left right and centre. I couldn't believe it. It was utterly unexpected and a little insane.
- But whenever I looked at Trudy, she was calm and collected. And everything she said was exactly the right thing. 
- She never reacted. She always responded calmly, and she never exacerbated the chaotic conflicts around her. Rather, her words had a curious power that extinguished the flames of anger.
- Whatever she had, I wanted it.
- I ordered the book immediately, and from the moment it arrived it has been the only book I'm able to read.
- I used to be a voracious reader but now reading feels like looking inside people's heads, and it's rarely a pleasant view.
- I study A Course In Miracles every day.
- A Course In Miracles, to me, feels like the key to the door out of hell. Like Jesus Christ himself came down and showed me where to find that door, and handed me the key to it at the same time.
- The irony is, of course, that Sandra Smith took me to that meeting.

## LinguaLink

- I start working part-time for [LinguaLink (now LinguaLogic)](https://lingualogic.es/).
- LinguaLink is owned and run by Lorraine Blackbourn and her partners, an British ex-pat couple.
- I teach a class on a Friday evening.
- Another woman teaches and finishes at the same time.
- She invites me for a tea after work one evening.
- She is an older woman with an adult daughter Zoe who is around my age, a little older perhaps.
- The whole meeting is about her persuading me to meet Zoe.
- The woman seems nearly desperate I meet her daughter Zoe.
- It's weird and reminds me of Sandra Smith's insistence that I meet her daughter Hazel.
- I'm reluctant mainly because of [the Hazel incident from the year before](2007.md#hazel-smith).
- Zoe's mum mentions how Zoe and Hazel had gone walking in the mountains.
- I become even more reluctant.
- I say I'm too busy, or whatever.
- Zoe's mum is relentless.
- Worn down a bit, I agree to meet Zoe.

## Zoe

- It must be February or March when I meet Zoe for the first time.
- We go for coffee.
- She spends a great deal of energy lauding the benefits of prostitution.
- I'm pretty horrified.
- It's the usual, oh high class hookers have a great life, type thing.
- I wonder if she is justifying something she does herself or if she is truly that ignorant.
- She has a young teenage daughter she is trying to get into "modelling".
- I find this very troubling.
- I wonder if Asia is safe and well now.
- Hazel Smith is all over this conversation but never mentioned.
- I wonder why Zoe doesn't mention her as her mother had done. 
- Anyway, Zoe and I remain friends.
- I rather liked her company, except for the things she would say sometime which were excruciating.
- When I moved back to Dénia in 2012, I rekindled our friendship.
- We hung out a bit; we were both writing books at that time and had a shared interest.
- Nevertheless, she would say ridiculous things at times, often, and it made my head hurt.

### Lauding male violence

- The death knell in our relationship came one afternoon when we went to the beach for a picnic with her younger daughter.
- Zoe spent the whole time talking about her ex-boyfriends; the violent men she had been in relationships with.
- The whole time.
- Every relationship she recounted was a tale of bitterness, sadness, and violation.
- Her daughter listened eagerly.
- I was horrified.
- It was when she started to retell the relationship she'd had with someone where they'd both been self-harming, I had enough.
- I had to try to reset the tone somehow, and bring back some love.
- I told a story about an ex-boyfriend who had really loved me.
- Zoe's daughter's face went from frowning to smiley.
- I explained that this man had loved me so much, he even loved my farts.
- Zoe starts to get uncomfortable.
- I explain that whenever I farted, on those rare occasions, he would grab me and put his nose right...
- Zoe stands up, and starts shouting; "Stop stop!"
- "That's enough!", she says, implying that she doesn't want her daughter to hear any more of this story.
- I'm flabbergasted.
- How can a loving and intimate, yes a little crazy, story like mine upset Zoe so much, especially when she'd just spent the last couple of hours relating every violent exchange between her and her ex-boyfriends.
- I was trying to present an alternative view to her 11-year-old daughter.
- It made my head hurt so much, I couldn't see Zoe again.
- I couldn't explain her behavior sufficiently to myself so that it made any sense either.
- However, in 2025, in the light of everything we know now, I wonder if she might have been recording our conversation, and for some reason, what I was saying didn't fit into the context of acceptable male violence.
- Were they still trying to groom me into some weird relationship where I would be frightened all the time and hand over my money?
- I expect so.

## Dénia TV

- Sometimes, late, I would flick through the TV channels to see what was going on.
- Usually I'd flick past Dénia TV because the signal was so poor you couldn't see or hear anything - my apartment was not more than a kilometer out of town.
- If it wasn't some weird porn on a loop, it'd be locals talking in a TV studio that looked like someone's garden shed.
- The porn on a loop was remarkable.
- A long blond haired naked woman stood completely still and upright while two naked grinning men ran round her and entered her one after the other.
- The original video lasted about two minutes, less even, and it was replayed over-and-over, week-after-week.
- I never considered the possibility the woman was sedated, but looking back she did indeed seem to be.
- Curiously, I saw one of the men working in the VW garage; the very short stocky one with ginger hair.

## Working for Elaine Black

- I worked for Elaine Black a lot when I lived in Dénia.

![Elaine](../../content/images/lorraine.png)

- Over the years 2007 to 2009, I worked for her at the [Lingualink academy (now Lingualogic)](https://lingualogic.es/en/) which she ran with a British expat couple.
- Later, in 2012-15, I worked for her as part of her own English academy, [the English Studio](https://www.englishstudiodenia.com/), which is still running today and is managed by her trans-identified daughter.
- During the years 2013-14, I also worked for the Spanish academy she worked for, [Grupo Glorieta](https://grupoglorieta.com/), and taught some intensive English classes paid for by the European Union due to the unemployment situation in Spain at that time. My Spanish tax records reflect some of this work.
- Curiously, one of the trumpet teachers may have attended one of these classes, under the name Marc, and I found him very attractive but I noticed his wedding ring immediately.

!!! tip "A conversation with Elaine"
    - Elaine was interested in which of the men in the class I liked, and I told her. 
    - She was surprised it hadn't been someone else, the cowboy-type sitting in front of me.
    - I said no, I didn't find the cowboy attractive at all. But the guy sitting at the end of that row, next to the muscle man, yes, I found him very attractive.
    - She looked up thoughtfully and said, "Um, but he's ..." and trailed off. 
    - I asked her, "What is he?". 
    - She said "never mind", and that was that.

- Aside from that, I worked cash-in-hand for Elaine whenever she needed me.
- At some point during this time we had an interesting conversation.
- I believe it was when I was working at Lingualink, so it could have been between November 2008 to March 2009. It had to be in the colder months because we had our coats.
- It was the end of the evening. I was teaching three men from the area, one of whom I [mentioned before](2007.md#hazel-smith), who may have been at HS's apartment the night I was there, and may have been sedated.
- Elaine started to talk about a woman she knew. She started with, "we know this woman" and I thought that to mean she and her friends had been discussing the woman.
- She explained that the woman had a new boyfriend who was a lot younger than her. She kept saying that none of it made any sense.
- Elaine looked thoughtful.
- I started to think about Hazel.
- Elaine went on to say the boyfriend was a footballer, for Dénia (maybe), and was extremely well known.
- I asked Elaine if the woman was British.
- Elaine said yes, and then she added that it just didn't make any sense that they would be together.
- I felt it must be Hazel Smith but Elaine did not mention any names.
- I wonder now if this was another example of the sedating and sex-ploitation epidemic in Dénia?
- Was Elaine getting suspicious even back then?
- Was that why I often heard people talk badly about Elaine, slandering talk, talk which annoyed me immensely?
- Was Elaine targeted online in the same way as I was, with the intention of destroying her because she knew what was going on and who was behind it?
- Had Elaine whistle-blown as some of the [stalker accounts](../2024/march.md#elaine-threats) appeared to suggest?

!!! tip "Suspicions"
    - The particular account I just linked to (which I now believe was run by the Smiths) was [tag-team gang-stalking me while I was being terrorized continuously on the run up to the piano concert in March 2024](../2024/march.md#online-threats-during-this-period).
    - Bizarrely, or perhaps just more proof of the wider involvement of criminal gangs into this sorry business, was owned by a woman who ended up standing for the [Party Of women in the UK election in July 2024](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/general-elections/6/political-parties/264/elections) alongside myself.
    - Seonaid appears to be familiar with the [Granny Smith account](../2025/january.md#seonaid-dawn-and-granny-smith) which I suspect was controlled by Sandra Smith.

    - Indeed, who the hell are these people?

## Enric

- Enric runs events for new arrivals to the area such as language interchange services, quiz nights, and other things to encourage community involvement with new and older arrivals.
- He works for the Dénia town hall in the capacity of [international relations officer](https://www.denia.es/es/denia/directori/directori.aspx?id=297).
- Through Enric around this time I meet good British friends, Alf & Petra, who I haven't managed to get in touch with yet but we're working on it.
