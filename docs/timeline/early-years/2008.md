## A Course In Miracles

- I never saw Hazel Smith again apart from that one time, fleetingly, but I did see her mother Sandra a couple of times.
- On one occasion she picked me up from outside my house and we drove over to Javea to attend a kind of "spiritual" event where there were two speakers, a psychic from Bulgaria, and Judy (the name may be incorrect but it's close), a Dutch yoga teacher who was giving a talk about A Course In Miracles.
- The psychic was extremely giggly and silly, and I was not impressed by her. She found me equally unappealing due to my suspicious attitude towards her and was a little violent towards me.
- The talk that Judy gave about A Course In Miracles blew my mind.
- As she began to describe what the book was about, the room erupted.
- Holy war kicked off with big arguments about God and religion. I couldn't believe it. It was utterly unexpected and a little insane.
- But whenever I looked at Judy, she was calm and collected. And everything she said was exactly the right thing. She never reacted, she always responded calmly, and she never exacerbated the chaotic conflicts going on around her. Rather, her words had a curious power that extinguished the flames of anger.
- Whatever she had, I wanted it.
- I ordered the book online immediately, and from the moment it arrived it has been the only book I'm able to read.
- I used to be a voracious reader but now reading feels like looking inside people's heads, and it's rarely pleasant.
- I study A Course In Miracles every day.
- A Course In Miracles, to me, feels like the key to the door out of hell. Like Jesus Christ himself came down and showed me where that door is, and handed me the key to it.
- The irony is, of course, that Sandra Smith took me to that meeting.

## Working for Elaine Black

- I worked for Elaine Black a lot over the years I lived in Dénia.
- Over the years 2007 to 2009, I worked for her at the [Lingualink academy (now Lingualogic)](https://lingualogic.es/en/) which she ran with a British expat couple.
- Later, in 2012-15, I worked for her as part of her own English academy, [the English Studio](https://www.englishstudioDénia.com/), which is still running today and is managed by her trans-identified daughter.
- During the years 2013-14, I also worked for the Spanish academy she worked for, [Grupo Glorieta](https://grupoglorieta.com/), and taught some intensive English classes paid for by the European Union due to the unemployment situation in Spain at that time. My Spanish tax records reflect some, not all, of this work.
- Curiously, the trumpet teacher may have attended one of these classes, under the name Marc, and I found him very attractive but I noticed his wedding ring immediately. I could be wrong but perhaps the man was some relation.

!!! tip "A conversation from that time"
    - Elaine was interested in which of the men in the class I liked, and I told her. 
    - She was surprised it hadn't been someone else, the cowboy type sitting in front of me.
    - I said no, I didn't find the cowboy attractive at all. But the guy sitting at the end of that row, next to the muscle man, yes, I found him very attractive.
    - She looked up thoughtfully and said, "Um, but he's ..." and trailed off. 
    - I asked her, "What is he?". 
    - She said "never mind", and that was that.

- Aside from that, I worked cash-in-hand for Elaine whenever she needed me.
- At some point during this time we had an interesting conversation.
- I believe it was when I was working at Lingualink, so it could have been between November 2008 to March 2009. It had to be in the colder months because we had our coats.
- It was the end of the evening. I was teaching three men from the area, one of whom I [mentioned before](2007.md#hazel-smith), who may have been at HS's apartment the night I was there, and may have been sedated.
- Elaine started to talk about a woman she knew. She started with, "we know this woman" and I thought that to mean she and her friends had been discussing the woman.
- She explained that the woman had a new boyfriend who was a lot younger than her. She kept saying that none of it made any sense.
- Elaine looked thoughtful.
- I started to think about Hazel.
- Elaine went on to say the boyfriend was a footballer, for Dénia (maybe), and was extremely well known.
- I asked Elaine if the woman was British.
- Elaine said yes, and then she added that it just didn't make any sense that they would be together.
- I felt it must be Hazel Smith but Elaine did not mention any names.
- I wonder now if this was another example of the sedating and sex-ploitation epidemic in Dénia?
- Was Elaine getting suspicious even back then?
- Was that why I often heard people talk badly about Elaine, slandering talk, talk which annoyed me immensely?
- Was Elaine targeted online in the same way as I was, with the intention of destroying her because she knew what was going on and who was behind it?
- Had Elaine whistle-blown as some of the [stalker accounts](../2024/march.md#elaine-threats) appeared to suggest?

!!! tip "Suspicions"
    - The particular account I just linked to (which I now believe was run by the Smiths) was [tag-team gang-stalking me in March 2024 with another account](../2025/january.md#seonaid-dawn-and-granny-smith) owned by a woman who ended up standing for the [Party Of Women in the UK election in July 2024](https://electionresults.parliament.uk/general-elections/6/political-parties/264/elections). 
    - Seonaid appears to be familiar with the [Granny Smith account](../2025/january.md#seonaid-dawn-and-granny-smith) also.

    - Indeed, who the hell are these people?

## Enric

- Enric runs events for the expats and new visitors to the area.
- He works for the Dénia town hall in the capacity of [international relations officer](https://www.denia.es/es/denia/directori/directori.aspx?id=297).
- Enric runs events for new arrivals, language interchange services, quiz nights, and other things to encourage community involvement with new and older arrivals.
- Through Enric I meet good British friends, Alf & Petra, who I haven't managed to get in touch with yet but we're working on it.
