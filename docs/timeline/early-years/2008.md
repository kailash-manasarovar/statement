## Working for Lorraine Blackbourn

- I worked for Lorraine Blackbourn a lot over the years when I was living in Denia.
- In 2007-9, I worked for her as part of Lingualink academy which she ran with an English couple.
- Later, in 2012-15, I worked for her as part of her own English academy, the English Studio, which is still running today and is managed by her trans-identified daughter, Jayden.
- During the years 2013-14, I also worked for the Spanish academy she worked for, and took some intensive English classes paid for by the European Union due to the unemployment situation in Spain at that time. My Spanish tax records reflect some of this work.
- Aside from that, I worked cash in hand every day for Lorraine whenever she needed me.
- At some point during this time we had an interesting conversation.
- I believe it was when I was working at Lingualink, so it could have been between November 2008 to March 2009. I remember this because we had our coats.
- It was the end of the classes. I was teaching three men from the area, one of whom I mentioned before, [Raul Perez](2007.md#hazel-smith), who may have been at Hazel Smith's apartment the night I was there and may have been sedated.
- Lorraine started to talk about a woman she knew, she said "we know" and I thought that to mean her and her friends.
- She explained this woman had a knew boyfriend who was ages younger than her, and none of it made sense.
- I started to think about Hazel.
- Lorraine went on to say the boyfriend was a footballer for Denia (maybe) and extremely well known.
- I asked Lorraine if the woman was British.
- Lorraine said yes, and it just didn't make any sense that they would be together.
- I felt it must be Hazel Smith but Lorraine did not mention any names.
- Was this another example of the sedating and sexploitation epidemic in Denia.
- Did Lorraine figure it all out as early as back then.
- Was that why I often heard people talk badly about Lorraine, which annoyed me immensely.
- Was Lorraine was targeted online in the same way as I was, with the intention of destroying her, because she knew what was going on?
- Had Lorraine whistle-blown as some of the [stalker accounts](../2024/march.md#lorraine-threats) appeared to suggest? This particular account (which I now believe was run by Hazel Smith) was [tag-teaming gang-stalking me in March 2024 with another account](../2025/january.md#seonaid-dawn-and-granny-smith) owned by a woman who ended up standing for the Party Of Women in July. An account which is also connected to the Sandra Smith account, see previous link. 
- You can't make this stuff up.
