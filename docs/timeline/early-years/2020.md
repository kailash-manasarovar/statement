- I live in Belfast City Centre in the Obel Tower.
- I have a lot of work, especially during Covid.
- I work to distract myself as I'm suffering from depression and anxiety.
- I work three jobs sometimes.
- I don’t like Belfast. It's a very harsh environment for me. 
- And, I was targeted by Belfast-based criminal gangs even before [the moment I arrived](#targeted-by-online-scammers), which set the tone for my whole time there.
- I realize I need to give back, to help others who have had similar childhood experiences to mine.
- I start volunteering with Childline and find out about trans ideology and the sterilization and mutilation of children.
- I am utterly horrified!
- I realize that if I had been born 30 years later, I would have sought comfort in trans ideology and the belief I didn’t have to be female anymore after serious and repeated sexual abuse.
- I'm only onsite at Childline in Belfast for a short while before we have another covid lock-down and the NSPCC set up their systems so we can all work from home.
- I end up volunteering for Childline online for about 2.5 years.
- *Criminal gangs of Belfast, Dénia, North London, and goodness knows elsewhere attend, via my hacked routers and laptops, every single counselling session I work!*
- Perhaps this is one of the ways they field for and subsequently harvest their self-harming, mostly female, minor-child porn-victims, ready for hacking and filming with their new online *friends*; subsequently streamed to millions of sick subscribers around the world.
- I tentatively join Twitter at one point in 2021 to keep up with the news around what's happening to children in the UK, but I get worried about being targeted by violent and aggressive men, and so I delete my account.

## Targeted by online scammers

- Before I even arrive in Belfast, I fall into the clutches of an extraordinarily unpleasant company [Key 1 Properties](https://www.keyoneproperty.co.uk/).
- The company is run by a wild man, Mark, and his family.
- The website has changed since 2020, and the street address for the business has also changed.
- No doubt online manipulation drew me into their clutches.
- I'm completely alone now, ripe for the pickings.
- I find them on Hotels.com, they're also advertising on AirBnB and similar.
- I book a flat to stay in for two weeks in December 2019 while I'm looking for permanent accommodation. 
- It's the only option coming up.
- I could find nothing else in the whole city.
- I end up having to pay them directly, i.e. outside the website, which is why their scam is successful.
- The property is an upstairs apartment on Ravenhill Court and may have been the scene of a horrific violent murder in the past.
- As I drive up, I see a black male coming out of the front door. I see him again on the street when I look out of the window later on.
- There is a bottle of whisky in the kitchen cupboard and the house stinks of smoke.
- I specifically requested non-smoking. 
- The apartment has security cameras all over the place; in the kitchen and bedroom, probably bathroom too.
- I didn't know what these items were at the time.
- I only realized what they were in retrospect when I bought some myself to use in the Obel Tower.
- I'm very uneasy; I have a terrible night in dread and fear, a living nightmare, without sleep, and I leave the following morning.
- I sleep next to an open window because of the stink of tobacco.
- My car was keyed while parked outside that night.
- The company insists they will not refund me; they are wild and rude; the sort of people that talk to you in a way that sounds like they only speak to people who are frightened of them.
- I do get some of my money back as I paid a chunk by credit card.
- I attempt to take them to small claims for the rest but they bully and threaten me so much I give up.
- They have a woman who apparently cleans for them lie - in writing - about the smell of smoke, and other things.
- It was overwhelming.
- It went on for months and I felt threatened and vulnerable.
- When I research them online, I find out that they are very likely a criminal gang; I read complaints just like mine; he's apparently driving around in a Ferrari; that sort of thing.
- I speak to my mother on the phone. I explain everything that has happened with these people. It's as if I had said nothing at all. She completely ignores me.
- The gangs will have been listening, noting her lack of interesting, assuring themselves even further that I am a worthy target and no-one will ever help me.
- Did I see this [Mark at a property I viewed a week later](#finding-a-flat-in-belfast)?
- This is the first moment I feel like I have ants all over me and I cannot get them off.
- I will feel this way until August 14th 2025.

### Finding a flat in Belfast

- I stay at the Marriott in Belfast and look for a rental property.
- Again, looking back, it seems I'm lured to places online.
- A curious incident occurs at the first apartment I look at where as we're coming out of the apartment a small wiry man who gives me a bad feeling is coming out of the opposite apartment with a scantily clad woman.
- Is he Mark from Key One?
- I always thought something was weird about that; staged.
- I eventually rent an apartment at the Obel Tower.
- It turns out the whole building is accessible by anyone and everyone.
- There is a bunch of skeleton keys that the caretakers have that open every single apartment in the building.
- The caretakers are rough Belfast men.
- It's not possible to secure your apartment from the inside. They can enter at any time. Apparently this is health and safety now!
- I am very uneasy the whole time I live there and I have a feeling someone could come into the flat at anytime.
- I even sleep with a knife close to my hand I'm so convinced I'm in danger. I kid you not. I even tweet about that.
- Could the Key 1 event be the *outrageous and traumatic event* they set up to explains continued fear and anxiety (like the conservatory bullying) which is actually instead coming from the regular sedation after going to sleep and men entering my apartment without my knowledge?
- Just like Denia?
- Are remote control sedating mechanisms placed in my bedroom by men who manage the building, or gangs that pay them for access to the keys and the whole building is being used for spy-cam sedated rape porn of single vulnerable women?
- Could it be possible?

### Transforming the experienced-based brain

- I begin my trauma therapy study and practice with Stephen Terrell from Austin Texas.
- When I was [on my knees in January 2019](interim.md#january-2019), I had prayed to Mary for help, and somehow I came across [Steve's website](https://www.austinattach.com/).
- I watched a few videos and listened to some lectures.

- Something resonated strongly.
- I noticed the picture of Bernadette behind his desk in his office.
- My intuition was telling me he could help me, and so I reached out to him.
- He said he wasn't able to take me on as a client as he was too busy, and in Texas, but instead he suggested I attend his courses and learn about the practice.
- I attend the first in-person course in Cork Ireland in February.

!!! tip "Visions past and future"
    - About 75 people, professional therapists and others, turned up for that first course in Cork.
    - At the end of the first day, Steve told us we may dream about him that night. He was joking of course.
    - I did dream of Steve that night. Well, his voice commented in the dream.
    - I had two visions, one of the past and one of the future.
    - In the first vision, I am pre-verbal, about 1 year old, and I'm practicing walking in the kitchen by hanging onto the cupboard and drawers and pulling myself around.
    - My aunt is looking after me and my cousin. I'm not sure where my mother is.
    - Suddenly, from behind, hands grab my throat and start to squeeze. I can't breath or speak and I'm terrified. I don't know who is behind me throttling me.
    - My aunt's voice says from behind, "Oh look, someone's throttling you Katie".
    - My cousin is going ballistic, screaming and crying.
    - I wake a little back in Cork, shocked and sweating. I fall back to sleep again.
    - It is my wedding day, except, I'm looking at myself through the eyes of the groom. 
    - We are outside. It is spring time and we are among a semi-circle of trees.
    - It's somewhere Mediterranean. Could it be Jerusalem?

    - It is a happy and joyous occasion.
    - I wake up.
    - God gave me a joyful and hopeful vision to ease the sudden realization that I had been silenced in the most appalling manner from nearly the beginning of my life. Ironically, I thought that the trumpet teacher was my betrothed, but I expect this was part of the NLP suggestion and online manipulation. 
    - Whoever my husband to be *is* in the vision, I am in his head looking out at myself.
    - Sometimes prophetic dreams do come true, and sometimes even in ways wondrously unimaginable by mere mortals.
    - I tweet about this dream in November 2023.

    [![TT dream](../../content/tweets/november-2023/tt-dream.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1728145799769375031)

    - It's likely I'm being stalked online by my cousin Leah at that time, at the request of North London criminal-gang connections to Spain.

- I have been attending these courses around three times a year since 2020 and I am now a qualified practitioner.
- It is curious that I didn't see Steve in person again until just a few days after teachers and staff at the conservatory of Dénia set up my 'funeral' in the attempt to completely destroy me. 
- At that training, in [June 2023](../2023/june.md#ireland), I was utterly traumatized, completely shattered; everyone noticed. Yet, again, Steve's work brought me back to my center of resilience and strength.
- [TEB](https://www.austinattach.com/transforming-the-experience-based-brain/) has given me the support and strength I needed to survive the 3-year-long, criminally vicious attack on my physical, psychological, emotional, and sexual wellbeing that I suffered at the hands of the people of Dénia including teachers and staff at the conservatory.

## End of December 2020

- I move to Lourdes in France.
- I am working as a contractor and full time technical writer for web3 software companies.
- I'm still working multiple jobs to distract myself from depression.
