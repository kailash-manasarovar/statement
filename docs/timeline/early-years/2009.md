## Alessandra gets sick

- I leave Denia in 2009 and return to London.
- I haven't seen Alessandra for a while.
- I bump into her in town one afternoon.
- She tells me she is sick; seriously sick.
- She's extremely anxious about it when I see her; fraught in fact.
- She wants to talk to me about the systemic candida I suffered as she relates the two things due to the immune system connection.
- She shows me her tightened skin on her arms and says this is her main and only symptom, and she could die if she doesn't get treatment immediately.
- I'm not sure I see anything.
- Indeed, it's hard to believe Alex is ill; she looks fit and well physically.
- She tells me she has to have a full bone marrow transplant or she'll die.
- It seems extreme. 
- I'm worried about her.
- She tells me there is a risk of the procedure failing but her surgeon is the topmost surgeon in Spain and she trusts him.
- She has the procedure and survives.
- When I meet her again in 2023, she tells me about the debilitating side-effects of the procedure; breathlessness, can't walk far, weight gain, other things.
- I suspect she was never unwell at all.
- I suspect she was manipulated with drugs like I was, and then choreographed events and online activity made her believe she was ill.
- I suspect a diagnosis of ill health was then confirmed by conspiring health professionals, and she was told she would die if she did not have this extremely perilous and invasive treatment whereby all her bone marrow was removed and replaced, thus battering her immune system.
- She told me she was the first person to have this procedure in Spain.
- I would like to be wrong about this.
- Not long before she "got ill", she had an abortion.
- The father was Paul.
- I wonder if this was necessary to ascertain whether or not Alex was a good candidate for the procedure and/or if foetal cells had been saved at that time for the future procedure.
- I pray I am wrong about this.
