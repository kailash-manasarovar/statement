## Alessandra gets sick

- I leave Dénia in 2009 and return to London until 2012.
- A month or so before I leave, I bump into Alessandra in the town one afternoon.
- I haven't seen her for a while.
- She tells me she is sick; seriously sick.
- She's anxious and scared; fraught in fact.
- She is happy to see me because wants to talk to me about the systemic candida I suffered as she has related the two things due to the immune system connection.
- She shows me tightened skin on her arms and says this is her main and only symptom, and she could die if she doesn't get treatment immediately.
- I'm not sure what I'm looking at but I trust she's telling the truth because she's so scared.
- Indeed, it's hard to believe Alex is ill; she looks fit and well physically.
- She tells me she has to have a full bone marrow transplant or she'll die.
- It seems extreme. 
- I'm worried about her.
- She tells me there is a high risk of the procedure failing but her surgeon is the topper-most surgeon in Spain and she trusts him.
- She has the procedure and survives.
- When I meet her again in 2023, she tells me about the debilitating side-effects of the procedure; breathlessness, can't walk far, weight gain, other things.
- I also believe she is now living in Hazel Smith's apartment in La Rosaleda; [the same apartment where Hazel (Fiona) poisoned me in 2007](../early-years/2007.md#hazel-smith).
- After my experience in Dénia that included conspiring healthcare professionals, I suspect Alessandra was never unwell at all.
- I suspect she was manipulated with drugs, just like I was, and then further manipulation with choreographed events while drugged and online activity made her believe she was ill.
- She probably had "chats" with Hazel who suggested she go to a doctor.. maybe one she knew.
- I suspect a diagnosis of ill health was then confirmed by these conspiring health professionals, and she was told she would die if she did not have this experimental, perilous and invasive treatment whereby all her bone marrow was removed and replaced, leaving her without an immune system.
- She told me she was the first person to have the procedure done in Spain.
- I wonder how much Hazel was paid to provide a test subject like Alessandra and how many of the medical professionals knew she was a lab-rat.
- Is there something even more sinister going on at Dénia hospital other than doctors who work there turning up on [switcheroo porn nights at the conservatory](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#four-distinct-men).
- Curiously, not long before she "got ill", Alessandra had an abortion.
- The father was Paul Matthews; another man who probably [turned up at my house while I was sedated](../2023/october.md#paul-and-alessandra).
- Did the criminal gangs need to gather foetal cells from Alex to ascertain whether or not she was an adequate test subject? 
- Did they also need foetal cells from Alessandra for the procedure itself?
