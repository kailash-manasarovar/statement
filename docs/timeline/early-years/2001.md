## Amsterdam

- I'm living and working in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
- I work for Philips Electronics as a webmaster.
- Brian, my boyfriend, drives over to help me move back to the UK.
- It is May probably.
- We stay at a Holiday Inn brand hotel near to the Rivierenbuurt where I lived in an attic room with no washing facilities (apart from one tap) and a chemical toilet in a small cupboard outside the door.
- As we're driving out of the hotel on our way to take the boat from Rotterdam, I see something strange.
- A black sedan-type car cuts us up while we're approaching the carpark exit.
- A woman is sitting in the front. She is wearing a thick white blindfold.
- Behind this car is another car of a similar nature. 
- The two black cars have a motorbike police escort and are driving in an aggressive manner, way over the speed limit.
- They want us to see them. 
- In the car behind, in the back seat, slunk down low, is an extremely ugly man. Really, really ugly.
- His ugliness startles me.
- After they speed off, I ask Brian if he saw the people in the cars?
- He said he hadn't.
- So I told him what I saw, because it was so strange.
- I believe this was the same man who stalked me on X, and followed me around [Lourdes and Cauterets](../2024/august.md#ugly) with a woman in August 2024?
- I believe he's famous.
- His sinister appearance that day (not his ugliness, the fact he was there, and perhaps a bad feeling about something I was consciously unaware of having happened...) concerned me enough that I described him in my [supplementary page to my handwritten letter](../2024/august.md#my-cubic-centimeter-of-chance) send to international law enforcement organizations and the mass media.
- While thinking about these events from the past, I have a sense of being in the hotel bar that night with Brian, and meeting a bunch of foreign men.
- I also remember the driver of one of the cars looking like the [younger brother of the first switcheroo trumpet teacher](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#the-younger-brother-of-the-first-man).
- If I'm right, this is the same [man who stalked me at my apartment in Lourdes](../2021/march.md#the-portuguese-man-next-door) in 2021.

### Memories of the past triggered on X

- The memory of this event was sparked around November 2024 by a post from an account that had been significantly involved in the cyber-stalking activity on X, [@january_myth](https://x.com/january_myth).
- I write extensively about [the `@january_myth` account here](../2024/march/13-end.md#january_myth).
- I believe Hazel/(Fiona) Smith was/is managing this account primarily but I could be wrong; the North London gangs' cyber-stalking tech seems to me to be more primitive.
- Anyway, in October 2024, the account posted this picture: https://x.com/january_myth/status/1846980956680278115.

- This image, coupled with the extremely ugly man who had stalked me on X and in person in the Pyrenees just a couple of months before, triggered a memory of what I had seen in Amsterdam in 2001.
- My thoughts and feelings about the blindfold lady have always been related to justice.

#### Asking Brian about it in 2024

- Of course, the moment I remembered the event [I contacted Brian about it](../2026/january.md#could-brian-have-known-who-ugly-was-back-in-2001).
- He said something strange and has now blocked me.
- I also contacted [Paul](../2025/january.md#paul) and Brian's brother Niall about it; men do talk after all.
- Crickets.

### What I didn't know at that moment was ...

- Around the same time, if not at the precise time that weird event happened, lawyers in offices around the world were making deals.
- In just a few year's time, I would end up with *a lot* of money, completely out of the blue; compensation from the Lockerbie air disaster in which an aunt had been murdered by Islamic terrorists.
- £250K to be precise.
- Did Ugly know about this too?
- Just to say, when I did get the money, I spent it all really wisely, and no-one got their hands on it like they wanted to.
- Sadly, I believe my brother and cousin were successfully targeted by North London gangs for their share.
- I spent mine on healing and education.
- However, this meant I became a high earner and possible innovator.
- So I was still a potential target for financial exploitation with the child rape-gang porn from 1989 that everyone I knew had heard about, except me.
- And so it began.

### Curtis Warren

- In trying to figure out who the ugly fellow is, I remembered reading about a famous Merseyside criminal gang-leader in the Guardian, probably some time in 1998.
- I mistakenly wondered if Ugly was the same man.
- It's curious I would think this, so why did I?
- Well, I knew Curtis Warren was in prison in Amsterdam, so the setting was correct.
- I had seen Ugly with Marie Henderson's daughter on X in the fake account, and she's a scouser and probably gypsy.
- I knew the man I saw must be famous enough to make everyone sit up and pay attention; which was what was obviously happening very soon after my handwritten letters reached their destinations.
- But I think the most interesting thing about the connection I made here is that I had been appalled and horrified to read in the Guardian that Curtis Warren had raped a boy, in the street, in broad daylight, in between some parked cars.
- I can only guess at what happened after [the distract and drugging at Les Halles in Lourdes](../2024/august.md#distract-and-drug-activity) in broad daylight.
- I asked ChatGPT who the man was and it came back Curtis Warren, who has no facial disfigurement at all.
- So I was wrong about that.
- Curtis Warren has strong Spanish family connections, however, and I wonder now if he and Ugly could be related.
- I also wonder if, perhaps, Ugly and his gypsy servant-family had popped in to visit Curtis in prison in May 2001 and whether they used their real names on the prison log book.
