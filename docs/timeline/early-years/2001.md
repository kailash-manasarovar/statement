## Amsterdam

- I'm living and working in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
- I work for Philips Electronics as a webmaster.
- Brian, my boyfriend, drives over to help me move back to the UK.
- It is May probably.
- We stay at a Holiday Inn brand hotel near to the Rivierenbuurt where I lived in an attic room with no washing facilities (apart from one tap) and a chemical toilet in a small cupboard outside the door.
- As we're driving out of the hotel on our way to take the boat from Rotterdam, I see something strange.
- A black sedan-type car cuts us up while we're approaching the carpark exit.
- A woman is sitting in the front. She is wearing a thick white blindfold.
- Behind this car is another car of a similar nature. 
- The two black cars have a motorbike police escort and are driving in an aggressive manner, way over the speed limit.
- They want us to see them. 
- In the car behind, in the back seat, slunk down low, is an extremely ugly man. Really, really ugly.
- His ugliness startles me.
- After they speed off, I ask Brian if he saw the people in the cars?
- He said he hadn't.
- So I told him what I saw, because it was so strange.
- I believe this was the same man who stalked me on X, and followed me around [Lourdes and Cauterets](../2024/august.md#ugly), in August 2024?
- The [same world-famous ugly man that was with the woman](../2024/august.md#ugly) in Lourdes, stalking me, in August 2024; whose sinister appearance that day (not his ugliness, the fact he was there, and perhaps a bad feeling about something I was unaware of having happened...) concerned me enough that I described him in my [supplementary handwritten letter](../2024/august.md#my-cubic-centimeter-of-chance) to law enforcement and the mass media.
- So, of course, I'm wondering if there was another sedated rape event back in 2001 in Amsterdam at the Holiday Inn that I took part in, and consequently starred in on the porn networks.
- And, of course, I'm wondering now if Brian was *in on it* and maybe he's already doing the right thing, God love him.
- And, I'd just like to mention, the [younger brother of the first switcheroo trumpet teacher](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#the-younger-brother-of-the-first-man), the same [man who stalked me at my apartment in Lourdes](../2021/march.md#the-portuguese-man-next-door); he was driving one of those cars. 
- Ugly can confirm all this for us, of course.

!!! tip "Memories of the past"

    - The memory of this event was sparked around November 2024 by a post from an account that had been significantly involved in the cyber-stalking activity on X, [@january_myth](https://x.com/january_myth).
    - I write extensively about [the `@january_myth` account here](../2024/march/13-end.md#january_myth).
    - I believe Hazel/(Fiona) Smith was/is managing this account primarily.
    - I did also believe that Trish Penny might have been required to manage the `@january_myth` account, and other accounts, by delegation from time-to-time, and you could tell because the language patterns changed.
    - In October 2024, the account posted this picture: https://x.com/january_myth/status/1846980956680278115.

    - This image, coupled with the extremely ugly man who had stalked me on X and in person in the Pyrenees just a couple of months before, triggered a memory of what I had seen in Amsterdam in 2001.
    - My thoughts and feelings about the blindfold lady have always been related to justice...

### What I didn't know at that moment was ...

- Around the same time, if not at the precise time that weird event happened, lawyers in offices around the world were making deals.
- In just a few year's time, I would end up with *a lot* of money, completely out of the blue; compensation from the Lockerbie air disaster in which an aunt had been murdered by Islamic terrorists.
- £250K to be precise.
- Just to say, when I did get the money, I spent it all really wisely, and no-one got their hands on it like they wanted to.
- I believe my brother and cousin were successfully targeted by North London gangs for their share.
- I spent mine on healing and education.
- However, this meant I became a high earner and possible innovator.
- So I was still a potential target for exploitation with the child rape-gang porn from 1989 that everyone I knew had heard about, except me.
- And so it began.
