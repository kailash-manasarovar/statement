## Amsterdam

- I'm living and working in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
- I work for Philips Electronics as a webmaster.
- Brian Higgins, my boyfriend, drives over to help me move back to UK.
- It is May probably.
- We stay at the Holiday Inn Express near to where I live in the Rivierenbuurt.
- As we're driving out of the hotel on our way to take the boat from Rotterdam, I see something strange.
- A black sedan-type car is driving with a woman sitting in it in the front. She is wearing a thick white blindfold.
- Behind this car is another car of a similar nature. 
- The two black cars have a police escort and are driving over the speed limit. They cut us up a little.
- Brian swears.
- In the last car, in the back seat, slunk down low, is an extremely ugly man. Really, really ugly.
- I ask Brian did he see the people in the cars? He didn't. So I told him what I saw, because it was so strange. 
- He may remember.
- Is this the same man who stalked me on X and followed me around [Lourdes and Cauterets](../2024/august.md#followed-by-the-gypsy-in-france) in August 2024?
