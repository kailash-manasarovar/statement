## Amsterdam

- I'm living and working in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
- I work for Philips Electronics as a webmaster.
- Brian, my boyfriend, drives over to help me move back to the UK.
- It is May probably.
- We stay at a hotel near to the Rivierenbuurt.
- As we're driving out of the hotel on our way to take the boat from Rotterdam, I see something strange.
- A black sedan-type car drives past us while we wait at to pull out of the carpark.
- A woman is sitting in the front. She is wearing a thick white blindfold.
- Behind this car is another car of a similar nature. 
- The two black cars have a police escort and are driving over the speed limit. They cut us up a little.
- Brian swears.
- In the car behind, in the back seat, slunk down low, is an extremely ugly man. Really, really ugly.
- His ugliness startles me.
- I ask Brian if he'd seen the people in the cars? He hadn't. So I told him what I saw, because it was so strange. 
- Could this be the same man who stalked me on X, and followed me around [Lourdes and Cauterets](../2024/august.md#followed-by-the-gypsy-in-france), in August 2024?
- It does seem unlikely but, given the nature of the events I'm going to relate in this police statement, including how a filmed series of vile sexual offenses against a child in 1989 captured the addled-minds and sad-secret lives of porn addicts and women haters everywhere, who knows.
- Perhaps the truth of this event will emerge soon; as will the truth around everything that happened to me in Dénia and elsewhere, who was involved and why, and how justice and fairness *will* prevail for women and girls.

!!! tip "Memories of the past"

    - The memory of this event was sparked by a post from an account that had been significantly involved in the cyber-stalking activity on X, [@january_myth](https://x.com/january_myth).
    - Eventually, it appeared that the account was being managed by Patricia, a British expat living near Dénia who was heavily involved in the stalking efforts and therefore plays a significant role in this story. 
    - Patricia knew some of the main players personally and was often mentioned by Dénia criminals who were terrorizing me on the X platform. 
    - The communication about her, which sometimes included mention of her family members, was never loving. Indeed, they often seemed to be *grassing her up* about specific criminal activity she may or may not have been involved in.
    - I thought Patricia might have use of the `@january_myth` account by delegation from time to time and that other people operated it at other times.
    - In October 2024, this curious account posted this picture: https://x.com/january_myth/status/1846980956680278115.

    - I now believe this image was a warning to me as, during the last two weeks of October 2024, I was ingesting extremely high levels of toxic substances, probably methanol, added to the water in my flat and it was affecting my sight detrimentally.
    - At the same time, I was seeing a lot of posts asking "do you have a bible at home?", and only in retrospect do these posts seem sinister as I did not fully grasp what was happening to me at the time.
    - This image, coupled with the extremely ugly man who had stalked me on X and in person in the Pyrenees just a couple of months before, triggered a memory of what I had seen in Amsterdam in 2001.
    - My thoughts and feelings about the blindfold lady have always been related to justice.
