## Amsterdam

- I'm living and working in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
- Brian Higgins, my boyfriend, drives over to help me move back to UK.
- It is May probably.
- We stay at the Holiday Inn Express near to where I live in the Rivierenbuurt.
- As we're driving out of the hotel on our way to the boat, I see something strange.
- A black sedan-type car is driving with a woman sitting in it. She is wearing a thick white blindfold.
- Behind this car is another car of a similar nature. 
- The cars have a police escort and are driving over the speed limit. They cut us up a little in fact.
- In the car behind, in the back seat, slunk down low is an extremely ugly man. Really really ugly.
- I ask Brian did he see it? He didn't. So I told him what I saw it was so strange. He may remember.
- Is this the same man who stalked me on X and followed me around Lourdes and Cauterets in August 2024?
