# Interim

## January 2017

- I change the medication in an attempt to stop putting on weight.
- I start feeling extraordinarily anxious.
- My mother offers me some valium.
- It works.

## Rape crisis Hornsey

- The Metropolitan Police refer me to the Rape Crisis centre in Hornsey.
- I'm on the waiting list for a therapist. I'm told it could take over year to get to the front of the queue.
- In the meantime, I attend group therapy.
- It may be the first session I attend. As I'm approaching the Rape Crisis building a man circles me on a bicycle. It is Winston M's accomplice from 1989. The man I could never remember the name of.
- He is extremely skinny. His legs are like sticks. He looks unwell; like he has been doing hard drugs for decades. I am in no doubt about who he is.
- I take my place in the circle.
- As we begin, the facilitator says to the group of women "just be aware that there could be a police officer here today".
- I tell the group what happened and who I saw, and how it made me feel, which was very anxious. I'm hyperventilating a little.
- One of the women at this session does not return for any other sessions.
- I can only explain this as an impromptu line up, and I most certainly pointed out the true perp.

## April 2017

- I stop taking the prescription medication but continue taking valium.

## July 2017

- I apply for the Metropolitan Police. I was so impressed by the women that interviewed me this time around, I want to be just like them.
- I pass the first interview.
- I'm called for the physical but I know I'll fail because of the valium so I don't go.

## July 2017 to January 2019

- I've become completely dependent on valium. I cannot go to work and be around people without it due to the anxiety I'm suffering.
- I am trying to micro-dose as much as possible but I need it every day.
- It is valium bought online so I'm not even sure what it is exactly.
- My family is impossible to live with.

## January 2019

- Regardless of the valium, I'm still suicidally depressed and life is bleak.
- One night I take an overdose of valium and go to A&E.
- The drug nurse meets me the next morning and puts me into the drug rehabilitation system.
- I quit valium and alcohol immediately.

!!! info
    - I wasn't drinking alcohol excessively but it wasn't helping either.

## February to June 2019

- I'm working 3 days a week at a crypto firm and going to outpatient rehab the other days in Finchley Central.
- Rehab is an AMAZING experience and incredibly helpful. Lifesaving.
- I see a psychotherapist once a week at Barnet Hospital.
- I'm healing.
- I realize I have to get away from my family if I want to really heal.
- I make plans to move to Ireland. I'm choosing Ireland because I have connected with a trauma therapist who is going to be giving courses there from February 2020.
- I'm still feeling suicidally depressed and anxious but less so, and I'm not using any medication or drinking alcohol.

## October 2019

- I leave London.
- I have limited communication with my parents, none with my brother.

## The forgivenet®

- I build and deploy the [forgivenet® crypto app](https://1frgvn.com/).

## 2020

- I live in Belfast and I have a lot of work, even during Covid.
- I work to distract myself. I work three jobs sometimes.
- I don't like Belfast. I find it a very harsh environment.
- I start volunteering with Childline and find out about trans ideology with regards to the sterilization and mutilation of children. I am utterly horrified!
- I realize that if I had been born 30 years later, I would have sought comfort in the trans belief that I didn't have to be female anymore after serious sexual abuse, and I would believe that life would be easier that way.
- I tentatively join Twitter at one point to keep abreast of what's going on, but I get scared and delete my account.

### Transforming the experienced-based brain

- I begin my trauma therapy study and practice with Stephen Terrell from Austin Texas.
- When I was [on my knees in January 2019](#january-2019), I had prayed to Mary for help, and somehow I came across [Steve's website](https://www.austinattach.com/).
- I watched a few videos and listened to some lectures.

- Something resonated strongly.
- I noticed the picture of Bernadette behind his desk in his office.
- My intuition was telling me he could help me, and so I reached out to him.
- He said he wasn't able to take me on as a client as he was too busy, and in Texas, but instead he suggested I attend his courses and learn about the practice.
- I attend the first in-person course in Cork Ireland in February.

!!! tip "Visions past and future"
    - About 75 people, professional therapists and others, turned up for that first course in Cork.
    - At the end of the first day, Steve told us we may dream about him that night. He was joking of course.
    - I did dream of Steve that night. Well, his voice commented in the dream.
    - I had two visions, one of the past and one of the future.
    - In the first vision, I am pre-verbal, about 1 year old, and I'm practicing walking in the kitchen by hanging onto the cupboard and drawers and pulling myself around.
    - My aunt is looking after me and my cousin. I'm not sure where my mother is.
    - Suddenly, from behind, hands grab my throat and start to squeeze. I can't breath or speak and I'm terrified. I don't know who is behind me throttling me.
    - My aunt's voice says from behind, "Oh look, someone's throttling you Katie".
    - My cousin is going ballistic, screaming and crying.
    - I wake a little back in Cork, shocked and sweating. I fall back to sleep again.
    - It is my wedding day, except, I'm looking at myself through the eyes of the groom. 
    - We are outside. It is spring time and we are among a semi-circle of trees.

    - It is a happy and joyous occasion.
    - I wake up.
    - God gave me a joyful and hopeful vision to ease the sudden realization that I had been silenced in the most appalling manner from nearly the beginning of my life. Ironically, I thought that the trumpet teacher was my betrothed, but I expect this was part of the NLP suggestion and online manipulation. 
    - Whoever my husband to be *is* in the vision, I am in his head looking at myself.

- I have been attending these courses around three times a year since 2020 and I am now a qualified practitioner.
- It is curious that I didn't see Steve in person again until just a few days after teachers and staff at the conservatory of Dénia set up my 'funeral' in the attempt to completely destroy me. 
- At that training, in [June 2023](../2023/june.md#ireland), I was utterly traumatized, completely shattered; everyone noticed. Yet, again, Steve's work brought me back to my center of resilience and strength.
- [TEB](https://www.austinattach.com/transforming-the-experience-based-brain/) has given me the support and strength I needed to survive the 3-year-long, criminally vicious attack on my physical, psychological, emotional, and sexual wellbeing that I suffered at the hands of the people of Dénia including teachers and staff at the conservatory.

## End of December 2020

- I move to Lourdes in France.
- I am working as a contractor and full time technical writer for web3 software companies.
- I'm still working multiple jobs to distract myself from depression.
