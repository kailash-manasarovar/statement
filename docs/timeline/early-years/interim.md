# Interim

## January 2017

- I change the medication in an attempt to stop putting on weight.
- I start feeling extraordinarily anxious.
- My mother offers me some valium.
- It works.

## Rape crisis Hornsey

- The Metropolitan Police refer me to the Rape Crisis centre in Hornsey.
- I'm on the waiting list for a therapist. I'm told it could take over year to get to the front of the queue.
- In the meantime, I attend group therapy.
- It may be the first session I attend. As I'm approaching the Rape Crisis building a man circles me on a bicycle. It is Winston M's accomplice from 1989. The man I could never remember the name of.
- He is extremely skinny. His legs are like sticks. He looks unwell; like he has been doing hard drugs for decades. I am in no doubt about who he is.
- I take my place in the circle.
- As we begin, the facilitator says to the group of women "just be aware that there could be a police officer here today".
- I tell the group what happened and who I saw, and how it made me feel, which was very anxious. I'm hyperventilating a little.
- One of the women at this session does not return for any other sessions.
- I can only explain this as an impromptu line up, and I most certainly pointed out the true perp.

## April 2017

- I stop taking the prescription medication but continue taking valium.

## July 2017

- I apply for the Metropolitan Police. I was so impressed by the women that interviewed me this time around, I want to be just like them.
- I pass the first interview.
- I'm called for the physical but I know I'll fail because of the valium so I don't go.

## July 2017 to January 2019

- I've become completely dependent on valium. I cannot go to work and be around people without it due to the anxiety I'm suffering.
- I am trying to micro-dose as much as possible but I need it every day.
- It is valium bought online so I'm not even sure what it is exactly.
- My family is impossible to live with.

## January 2019

- Regardless of the valium, I'm still suicidally depressed and life is bleak.
- One night I take an overdose of valium and go to A&E.
- The drug nurse meets me the next morning and puts me into the drug rehabilitation system.
- I quit valium and alcohol immediately.

!!! info
    - I wasn't drinking alcohol excessively but it wasn't helping either.

## February to June 2019

- I'm working 3 days a week at a crypto firm and going to outpatient rehab the other days in Finchley Central.
- Rehab is an AMAZING experience and incredibly helpful. Lifesaving.
- I see a psychotherapist once a week at Barnet Hospital.
- I'm healing.
- I realize I have to get away from my family if I want to really heal.
- I make plans to move to Ireland.
- I'm still feeling suicidally depressed and anxious but less so, and I'm not using any medication or drinking alcohol.

## October 2019

- I leave London.
- I have limited communication with my parents, none with my brother.

## 2020

- I live in Belfast and I have a lot of work, even during Covid.
- I work to distract myself. I work three jobs sometimes.
- I don't like Belfast. I find it a very harsh environment.
- I start volunteering with Childline and find out about trans ideology with regards to the sterilization and mutilation of children. I am utterly horrified!
- I realize that if I had been born 30 years later, I would have sought comfort in the trans belief that I didn't have to be female anymore after serious sexual abuse, and I would believe that life would be easier that way.
- I tentatively join Twitter at one point to keep abreast of what's going on, but I get scared and delete my account.

## End of December 2020

- I move to Lourdes in France.
- I am working as a contractor and full time technical writer for web3 software companies.
- I'm still working multiple jobs to distract myself from depression.
