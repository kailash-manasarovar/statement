## First class of January

Domingo tells me he has "decided" everything is OK and we can continue with classes
I'm horrified by his blase demeanour and request a new teacher from the management

## Joan Carles Poquet

Joan Carles is my new teacher
I can hear myself being talked about throughout the conservatory
I explain to Joan what happened and how I was appalled at Domingo's brutishness, and I also told him about how he has an inappropriate view of minor girls
The rest of the academic year is uneventful except I feel a lot of negativity towards me at the conservatory
I love playing the piano however, it's a huge privilege and joy

## Maria Hontanilla

In September I start in the second year of professional studies and Maria is my new teacher
I'm sick a lot this autumn
My studies are fine but I have other things on my mind

## Statement to the Metropolitan police

Since 2006, I had spent a lot of time thinking about what had happened to me in 1989, and I had a fuller story
I write a statement to the metropolitan police on my laptop and send it to them via email
The statement was very detailed, names, addresses, etc and events such as being drugged and raped, repeatedly
I spend the whole of October writing the statement and send it on 1 November
I become retraumatized from doing so
