## First class of January

- After Christmas break, Domingo tells me he has "decided" everything is OK and we can continue with classes.
- I'm horrified by his blase demeanor after everything that has happened and I request a new teacher from the management.
- This really *really* pisses him off.

## Domingo pretends he has another girlfriend

- The piano students, including myself, all go to listen to a piano performance at the [Dénia Centro Social](https://www.denia.com/en/centro-social/).
- I sit with Joan Carles and Paqui Fornet.
- Domingo arrives with a very loud woman who talks in a rough manner so that everyone can hear her.
- I later realize that this woman is a nurse, or medical professional, who works at the [Dénia medical centre in Carrer de Beniarmut](https://www.denia.com/en/centro-medico/) where I was signed up for care since 2022.
- I always saw her smoking outside, sometimes with the scanner technician, whenever I visited my doctor in 2023.

## Joan Carles

- Joan Carles becomes my new piano teacher. He is quiet and respectful and I feel I can tell him everything that happened, which I do, including Domingo's inappropriate attitude and sexualization of teenage girls.
- Joan Carles listens, and says nothing.
- I explain to Joan Carles that Domingo shouldn't ask students out for coffee. It's inappropriate and causes problems.
- I can hear myself being talked about throughout the conservatory, and the word "coffee" is prevalent.
- The rest of the academic year is uneventful except I feel a lot of negativity towards me at the conservatory.
- I love playing the piano however. It's a huge privilege and joy. I try and put the weird stuff behind me.
- At the spring concert, I play [Bach invention in D minor](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Trs8Nh-PmpUj0D7NT2JqxjEZITuMw1Zj/view?usp=drive_link).
- At the summer concert, I play, from memory [Granados Andaluz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fUYOFNUYwoI4sSeFwFud5XpisiUU47zl/view?usp=drive_link).
- I also play a mini-concert at the end of the year.

## Horror novel AntiChrist by Jack Chardwood

- Domingo the piano teacher's outrageous behavior inspires me to write a horror novel.
- Most of this book is my attempt at trying to make sense of how men can hate women so much. It is also my attempt at healing such lost people.
- I publish the book on Amazon in October. Click the image for more info.

## Greek man with a twitch, and Sylvie

- I start hanging out a little bit with a French woman who lives in Dénia.
- Her name is Sylvie and she worked for an estate agent on the Avenida Marquesat. I visited her there on a few occasions.
- Our relationship is ostensibly for a language interchange but we end up just speaking English.
- She introduces me to her friend, a Greek man. Dimitri may be his name.
- He may have been one of the [muscle men outside the tunnel](../2023/december.md#muscle-men-outside-the-tunnel) I saw in December 2023.
- Sylvia is suggestive about him, that he likes me maybe. I'm not interested.
- He's been bodybuilding.
- One evening he walks me home (unnecessarily) after the three of us were out somewhere.
- He blinks at me in a weird way the whole time.

![Twitchy bodybuilder](../../content/images/twitchy-bodybuilder.png)

- It's very strange.
- I'm reminded of a PTSD twitch after child sexual abuse that I may have mentioned to the police in 2006.
- If Dimitri was "twitching" on purpose to upset me, like, perhaps, the people at [the meditation retreat may have been in December 2023](../2023/december.md#the-finnish-lady), then the question is how would he know about the twitch?
- It seems to me, the only way anyone could have known about this was if they had seen the child gang-rape porn from 1989 where, I have been led to believe, my eyes were twitching as the only possible way of expressing myself while sedated during a vicious and violent sexual attack by multiple men.
- Do events like this trigger me [going back to the police](#statement-to-the-metropolitan-police) with a fuller statement a month or so later?
- If so, it does seem to suggest Dénia criminals *already* had information that could jail pedophiles and decided that instead of making the world a better place, they would use the information to terrorize a victim of pedophile gangs even more.
- If true, the information and video clips must have come from the Smiths.
- I get angry with Sylvie for introducing me to this dickhead and I never see her again.
- I wonder where she is now.
- Is Sylvie [Silvia](../2023/february.md#silvia)? If so, is she safe and well?

## Frozen shoulder

- I start to suffer really badly with two frozen shoulders; it is really bad on the right side and I cannot move my arm without a lot of pain.
- I end up suffering with this, to a lesser and lesser degree, for about 6 years.
- I still have very little mobility in my shoulders as a consequence.
- Frozen shoulder can sometimes be considered an autoimmune problem, and can also be the result of side-effects from certain medications or substances.

## Maria Hontanilla

- In September I start the second year of professional studies and Maria is my new teacher. 
- I would have preferred to continue with Joan Carles but the decision has been made.
- I'm sick a lot this autumn with continuous colds and flu.
- My studies are fine but I have other things on my mind.
- Mercedes begins with Domingo as her teacher and it is clear she was never particularly advanced on the piano and doesn't even know how to pedal.

## Statement to the Metropolitan police

- Since 2006, when I first [reported child sexual abuse to the police](2006.md#reporting-child-sexual-abuse-to-the-metropolitan-police), I had spent a lot of time thinking about what had happened to me in 1989, and over the years I had pieced together a more complete picture.
- Domingo's behavior was so disturbing to me that I realized that I still had a lot of healing to do around personal boundaries, although it was clear the situation with Domingo had been very much out of my control.
- His behavior somewhat triggered my decision to return to the police and make a fuller statement. 
- Since 2006, there were hugely positive developments in terms of justice for sexual abuse survivors, see [Jimmy Savile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile), etc., and the police made it clear that sex-offense victims will be believed.
- I take a full month to write a statement to the Metropolitan Police on my laptop in my living room. When I'm done, on 1 November 2015, I send it to them via email.
- The statement is very detailed; names, addresses, car descriptions, and events such as being drugged and gang raped, and specifics which suggest I had been sedated on more than one ocassion in the presence of groups of black men.
- The process of writing this re-traumatizes me massively. I have no emotional support. My family is uninterested and extremely unhelpful.
- The police arrange for me to make another video statement in London.
- They claim, at that time, they have no records of my visit in 2006 but that seems unlikely.

!!! critical "Were Dénia hackers reading my police statement as I wrote it in 2015?"
    - From what I know now, I'm pretty certain the hackers who targeted me over the last years (2022-25) had access to my home network at the time I wrote this statement.
    - Words, phrases, and behaviors I detailed in the statement were re-enacted *exactly* by teachers at the conservatory as part of the terror they inflicted on me; clearly with the intention of triggering severe psychological and emotional distress.
    - It may be sensible to assume that, if the hackers were members of mass-voyeur porn gangs, the more sordid details of my statement would have interested them greatly.
