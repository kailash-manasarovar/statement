### Reporting child sexual abuse to the Metropolitan Police

- I go with my mother to Highgate courthouse building to report the child sexual abuse I had remembered during a therapy session that took place in December 2005.
- The interview, with one detective from Hornsey Metropolitan Police, was recorded by a woman PC.
- I had remembered one instance of being drugged and gang raped by a grooming gang that had targeted me in North London when I was 16 in 1989.
- Remembering this was very traumatizing.
- I also remembered other smaller peripheral details at that time; such as, for example, a man with a black case, which I believed, and said, was a video VHS camera although I didn't remember seeing it.
- At the time of this interview, I was studying for my PhD at the technology department of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid and I lived in Madrid.
- I suffered from re-traumatized PTSD and I found it extremely difficult to be among people at the university and elsewhere.

!!! info "Why is this important?"
    - I believe the child sexual abuse I experienced at the hands of North London grooming gangs in 1989 to be the foundation of everything that has been happening to me in Dénia more recently.
    - I believe the porn gangs of Dénia found out about what happened to me via hacking, and have even tracked down the various porn films taken of me being raped as a child in 1989.
    - I believe now that the gang stalking I endured at the hands of teachers and staff at the conservatory masked something much more sinister.
    - I believe that my abuse history and the recordings taken from online voyeurism have been monetized by the porn gangs of Dénia, and I also believe that their true intention was to somehow recreate what I had suffered in 1989 for the enjoyment of rape porn addicts the world over.
