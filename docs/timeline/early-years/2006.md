!!! tip "Why so much information?"
    - Early years information is critical to understanding current events in a number of ways:
        1. The criminal activity I have encountered is perpetrated by honey-trap gangs who, by definition, are in it for long game rewards.
        2. People I encountered in those earlier years play significant roles later on.
        3. It's essential for the reader to understand my state of mind in order to understand some of  motives behind later events and my reaction to them.
        4. Describing some of the more sinister psychological traps the criminal gangs can inflict on the unwary via social media may be helpful to parents, guardians, and perhaps even law enforcement agencies trying to understand how criminal networks, or vast networks of what we used to call "perverts", or sex offenders, manage to control and manipulate huge numbers of children and young people.

### Reporting child sexual abuse to the Metropolitan Police

- I go with my mother to Highgate courthouse building to report the child sexual abuse I had remembered during a therapy session that took place in December 2005.
- The interview, with one detective from Hornsey Metropolitan Police, was recorded by a woman PC.
- I had remembered one instance of being drugged and gang raped by a grooming gang that had targeted me in North London when I was 16 in 1989.
- Remembering this was very traumatizing.
- I also remembered other smaller peripheral details at that time; such as, for example, a man with a black case, which I believed, and said, was a video VHS camera although I didn't remember seeing it.
- At the time of this interview, I was studying for my PhD at the technology department of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid and I lived in Madrid.
- I suffered from re-traumatized PTSD and I found it extremely difficult to be among people at the university and elsewhere.

!!! info "Why is this important?"
    - I believe the child sexual abuse I experienced at the hands of North London grooming gangs in 1989 to be the foundation of everything that has been happening to me in Dénia more recently.
    - I believe the porn gangs of Dénia found out about what happened to me via hacking, and have even tracked down the various porn films taken of me being raped as a child in 1989.
    - I believe now that the gang stalking I endured at the hands of teachers and staff at the conservatory masked something much more sinister.
    - I believe that my abuse history and the recordings taken from online voyeurism have been monetized by the porn gangs of Dénia, and I also believe that their true intention was to somehow recreate what I had suffered in 1989 for the enjoyment of rape porn addicts the world over.

### Move to Dénia

- I moved to Dénia to live alone and write my PhD thesis, returning to Madrid to see my professor, Pedro Gomez Vilda, from time to time.
- I lived at Cami Llavador 5, Dénia 03700 Alicante.

### Guardian Soulmates

- Friends recommended I joined Guardian Soulmates. In retrospect it was a terrible idea, I was reeling from the trauma.
- Anyway, foolishly I joined and met a boy Dave Porter who love bombed me, and I invited him out to Denia.
- He visited and we had sex and it was all very weird and something wasn't right.
- Prior to him visiting, I was very *very* unsure about what was going on, and I asked a psychic for advice.
- There were these spiritualist meetings going on in Denia that I attended just out of curiosity really.
- A woman called Sandra Smith organized them.
- I only went to one, I believe, and a "famous" physic had been there, a gay man from Benidorm with a handlebar moustache.
- I asked him a question about this David Porter who I was worried about
- The psychic said something to me at that time which was very strange and gave me pause, which was "oh it's good someone like you is doing this" (as in joining online dating). 
- What did he mean, someone like you? I could not shake off the obvious child sexual abuse reference that he was implying.
- Did this man know who I was and what had happened to me already? Did Sandra Smith know who I was already? Did they know I was able to support myself financially? Was this the start of me being targeted in Denia?
- Consequently, I met this man David Porter, and, unbelievably and utterly horrifyingly for me, I believe he filmed me having sex with him with the help of his flatmates who seemed to have a studio all set up for that purpose in Stoke Newington. I met him that one time in London and he ghosted me immediately afterwards.
- Curiously, although he broke all communication with me after when I believe he filmed me at his flat having sex, there was online social media activity for a while afterwards which now, thinking back, seemed very similar to the kind of stalking engaged in by Hazel and Sandra Smith online on Twitter in 2025.
- I informed the Metropolitan Police about this anonymously a few months later. It was less than a year after I had remembered being gang raped by Winston May and his cohort in 1989 and reported it to the police who did nothing about it.
- I have to ask myself, does information from victims of child sexual abuse get shared around with criminal gangs after the police speak to the suspects, who they know very well are guilty? 
- Do the police gather information that they share with criminals?
- For what purpose might they do that? Could it be global porn networks?
