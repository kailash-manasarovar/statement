!!! tip "Why so much historical information?"
    - Early years information is critical to understanding current events in a number of ways:
        1. The criminal activity I have encountered is perpetrated by honey-trap gangs who, by definition, are in it for long game rewards.
        1. People I encountered in earlier years play significant roles later on.
        1. As I lived through the terror in Dénia, it became clear to me that my experiences had started a long time previously. Initially, I believed, in 2014 when I first joined the conservatory. It then became obvious that I had been targeted by criminal gangs in Dénia as early as 2006. Now, I believe, it's highly likely that British criminal gangs with strong connections to Spain have played a malevolent role in my life since 1989, watching and waiting.
        1. Given I was unaware of these long-standing conspiracies until very recently, it's essential for the reader to have some insight into my state of mind in order to understand the various groups' motives, including the relentless gang-stalking and choreographed events designed to terrorize me, and my reactions to them.
        1. My descriptions of some of the more sinister psychological traps technologically-advanced criminal gangs can inflict on the unwary via social media may be helpful to parents, guardians, and perhaps even law enforcement agencies trying to understand how criminal networks, including vast networks of what we used to call "perverts", or sex offenders, control and manipulate huge numbers of women, children, and young people.

### Reporting child sexual abuse to the Metropolitan Police

- I go with my mother to the old Highgate courthouse building to report the child sexual abuse I had remembered during a therapy session that took place in December 2005.
- The interview, with one detective from Hornsey Metropolitan Police, was recorded by a woman PC.
- I had remembered one instance of being drugged and gang raped by a Tottenham rape gang that had targeted me in North London when I was 16 in 1989.
- Remembering this single event was extremely traumatizing.
- I also remembered other smaller peripheral details at that time; such as, for example, a man with a black case, which I believed, and said, was a video VHS camera although I didn't remember seeing it.
- I had no other memories concerning filming and only a single instance of gang rape that took place in a house in Plevna Crescent N15. In fact, in 2006 I did not give the police the street name, that came later, in my second report to the police in 2016.
- At the time of the interview, I was studying for my PhD at the technology department of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid and I lived in Madrid.
- After remembering this horrible event and going to the police about it, I suffered from a debilitating re-traumatized PTSD and I found it extremely difficult to be among my colleagues and classmates at the university and found some comfort in isolating myself from the world.

!!! info "Why is this important?"
    - I believe the child sexual abuse I experienced at the hands of North London grooming gangs in 1989 at the foundation of everything.
    - I believe the porn gangs of Dénia found out about what happened to me in 1989, and even have copies of various porn films taken of me being raped as a child, events I still have no recollection of.
    - I believe that teachers and staff at the conservatory were able to justify attacking and persecuting me relentlessly because they were aware of this pedophile porn and blamed me for it.
    - Furthermore, I believe the original films and the enormous amount of content the people of Dénia have seen from hacking my network and watching me continuously, i.e. online mass voyeurism, have been monetized by the porn gangs of Dénia. 
    - I also believe that their original intention was to frighten me into leaving the conservatory for good in June 2023, never to be seen again, while the porn gangs would continue to stalk me and somehow recreate the same thing I had suffered in 1989 for the enjoyment of rape porn addicts the world over.
    - I didn't let that happen and so everything escalated into a can of roaming and international worms which I hope will make Dénia famous.

## September 

### Move to Dénia

- I moved to Dénia to live alone and write my PhD thesis, returning to Madrid to see my professor from time to time.
- I lived at Cami Llavador 5, Dénia 03700 Alicante.

### Guardian Soulmates

- Friends recommended I joined Guardian Soulmates. In retrospect it was a terrible idea, I was reeling from the trauma.
- Anyway, foolishly I joined and met a boy Dave Porter who love bombed me, and I invited him out to Denia.
- He visited and we had sex and it was all very weird and something wasn't right.
- Prior to him visiting, I was very *very* unsure about what was going on, and I asked a psychic for advice.
- There were these spiritualist meetings going on in Dénia that I attended, just out of curiosity really.
- A woman called Sandra Smith organized the meetings, and I saw her on the stage doing readings for people.
- I never interacted.
- I only went to one or two of these meetings, I believe, and at one of them, a "famous" physic had been there; a large muscular gay man from Benidorm with a handlebar moustache.
- After the meeting, I privately asked him a question about this David Porter from Guardian Soulmates who I was worried about.
- The psychic said something to me at that time which was very strange, and gave me pause. He said, "oh it's good someone like you is doing this" (as in joining online dating). 
- What did he mean, someone like you? I could not shake off the obvious child sexual abuse reference that he was implying.
- Did this man know who I was and what had happened to me already? Did Sandra Smith know who I was already? Did they know I was able to support myself financially? Was this the first instance of me being targeted by honey-trap gangs?
- Consequently, I met this man David Porter, and, unbelievably and utterly horrifyingly for me, I believe he filmed me having sex with him with the help of his flatmates who seemed to have a studio all set up for that purpose in Stoke Newington, London. He ghosted me immediately afterwards.
- Curiously, although he broke off all communication with me, there was some social media activity for a while afterwards which now, thinking back, was extremely similar to the kind of online stalking I endured in parallel to the in-person gang stalking.  The same intriguing content, trigger words and images, and suggestive posts. I now wonder if even my 56k modem was hacked at that time. It seems likely.
- I informed the Metropolitan Police about this anonymously a few months later. It was less than a year since I had remembered sexual assaults from 1989 where I was drugged and sedated, and I had reported these hideous crimes to the police who did nothing about them.
- I have to ask myself, does information from victims of child sexual abuse get shared around with criminal gangs after the police speak to the suspects, who they know very well are guilty? 
- Is it possible that certain faction of police (perhaps those addicted to porn) gather information about sex abuse victims and maybe share it with criminals? This is certainly what was happening in Rochdale and elsewhere. Why not North London too?
