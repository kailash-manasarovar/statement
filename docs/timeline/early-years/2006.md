!!! tip "Why so much historical information?"
    - Early years information is critical to understanding current events in a number of ways:
        1. The criminal activity I have encountered is perpetrated by honey-trap gangs who, by definition, are in it for long game rewards.
        1. People I encountered in earlier years play significant roles later on.
        1. As I lived through the terror in Dénia, it became clear to me that my experiences had started a long time previously. Initially, I believed, in [2014 when I first joined the conservatory](2014.md#at-the-conservatory). It then became obvious that I had been targeted by criminal gangs in Dénia as early as 2006. Now, I believe, it's highly likely that British criminal gangs with strong connections to Spain have played a malevolent role in my life since 1989, watching and waiting. 
        1. Indeed, [events from 2005](../2022/july.md#crystal-dreaming) suggest that I had been targeted long before I went to the police in 2006.
        1. These facts suggest that the lives of historical victims of pedophile rape and porn gangs, especially where police have failed to act decisively, remain in continual jeopardy.
        1. Given I was unaware of these long-standing conspiracies until very recently, it's essential for the reader to have some insight into my state of mind in order to understand the various groups' motives - including the relentless gang-stalking and choreographed events designed to terrorize me - and my reactions to them.
        1. The criminal gangs expected to be able to do whatever they wanted with me without much bother, as they no doubt have done to thousands of other women and girls. However, it is essential to understand that even though they were under the impression that I was completely alone and friendless, that has never really been the case.
        1. Insight into my state of mind over the last years leaves us in no doubt that the sole intention behind terrorizing me was my death and, therefore, the actions of everyone involved constitute attempted murder.
        1. Furthermore, my descriptions of some of the more sinister psychological traps technologically-advanced criminal gangs can inflict on the unwary via social media may be helpful to parents, guardians, and perhaps even law enforcement agencies trying to understand how criminal networks, including vast networks of what we used to call "perverts", or sex offenders, control and manipulate huge numbers of women, children, and young people. 
        1. Indeed, given my hacked devices are full of advanced criminal honey-trap software and similar, it's surprising and disappointing that the police are wholly uninterested in it.

## January

### Reporting child sexual abuse to the Metropolitan Police

- I go with my mother to the old Highgate courthouse building to report the child sexual abuse I had remembered during a therapy session that took place in December 2005.
- The interview, with one detective from Hornsey Metropolitan Police, was recorded by a woman PC.
- I had remembered one instance of being drugged and gang raped by a Tottenham rape gang that had targeted me in North London when I was 16 in 1989.
- Remembering this single event was extremely traumatizing.
- I also remembered other smaller peripheral details at that time; such as, for example, a man with a black case, which I believed, and said, was a video VHS camera although I didn't remember seeing it.
- I had no other memories concerning filming and only one memory of the gang rape that took place in a house in Plevna Crescent, London N15. In fact, in 2006 I did not give the police the street name; that came later, in my second report to the police in 2016.
- I also did not mention in 2006 how the rape-gang had got hold of at least three other friends of mine. I mentioned this in 2016 and I believe the police spoke to those people. It's not clear if they had anything helpful to say. Sedating and poisoning victims is an extremely effective way to commit crimes against them.
- I did mention in 2016 a high level of racism towards me from the gang; vile things they said to me, insults, comments. 
- They only went for the white girls from my group of friends, although I did report seeing one black victim.
- At the time of the interview, I was studying for my PhD at the technology department of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid and I lived in Madrid, Spain.
- After remembering this horrible event and going to the police about it, I suffered from a debilitating re-traumatized PTSD and I found it extremely difficult to be among my colleagues and classmates at the university and found some comfort in isolating myself from the world.

!!! info "Why is this important?"
    - I believe the child sexual abuse I experienced at the hands of North London grooming gangs in 1989 is at the foundation of everything I am about to relate.
    - I believe the porn gangs of Dénia found out about what happened to me in 1989, and even have copies of various porn films taken of me being raped as a child, events I still have no recollection of.
    - I believe that teachers and staff at the conservatory were able to justify attacking and persecuting me relentlessly because they were aware of this pedophile porn and blamed me for it happening and were utterly disgusted with me because it happened to me!
    - Furthermore, I believe the original films and the enormous amount of content the people of Dénia have seen from hacking my home network and devices, and watching me continuously, i.e. online mass voyeurism, have been monetized by the porn gangs. 
    - I also believe that the original intention was to frighten me into leaving the conservatory for good in June 2023, never to be seen again, while the porn gangs would continue to stalk me and somehow recreate the same thing I had suffered in 1989 for the enjoyment of rape porn addicts the world over.
    - I didn't let that happen and so everything escalated into a can of unpredictable, roaming international worms which I hope will make Dénia famous.

- Astoundingly, the detective makes constant sexist comments and jokes to the female police officer.

## September 

### Move to Dénia

- I moved to Dénia to live alone and write my PhD thesis, returning to Madrid to see my professor from time to time.
- I lived at Cami Llavador, Dénia 03700 Alicante.

### Guardian Soulmates

- Friends recommended I join Guardian Soulmates. In retrospect it was a terrible idea, I was reeling from sexual trauma.
- Anyway, foolishly I joined and met a boy Dave Porter who manipulated me by love bombing me on one occasion which he never repeated. I invited him out to Dénia.

!!! tip "Dave Porter's gang"
    - Highly likely to be connected to Dave's North London associates, if it's not him himself, the following account:

    ![Dave](../../content/images/fake-accounts/dave.png)

- He visited and we had sex and it was all very weird and something wasn't right.
- Just before he left Spain, he told me about how he had been chatting up a 15-year old the previous weekend at a mate's party.
- Prior to him visiting, I was very *very* unsure about what was going on, and I asked a psychic for advice.
- There were these spiritualist meetings going on in Dénia that I attended, just out of curiosity really. They were run and attended by Brits.
- A woman called Sandra Smith organized the meetings. She sat on the stage with some others doing readings for people.
- I never interacted.
- I only went to one or two of these meetings, I believe, and at one of them, a "famous" physic had been there; a large muscular gay man who lived in Benidorm with a coiffed handlebar moustache.
- After the meeting, I privately asked him a question about this Dave Porter from Guardian Soulmates who I was worried about.
- The psychic said something to me at that time which was very strange, and gave me pause. He said, "it's good someone like you is doing this" (as in joining online dating). 
- What did he mean, someone like you? I could not shake off the obvious child sexual abuse reference that he was implying.
- Did this man know who I was and what had happened to me already? Did Sandra Smith know who I was already? Did they know I was able to support myself financially? Was this the first instance of me being targeted by honey-trap gangs?

!!! important "I was a potential honey trap target from 2003"
    - In 2003, I had received a large amount of money as compensation from an aunt who had been murdered in a terrorist attack.
    - I used this money to support myself through university to gain a masters and a PhD.
    - I also used this money to pay for the trauma healing I needed related to historical child sex offenses.
    - There was a repeat payment a year or so later, and a smaller payment after that.
    - There was no way anyone in Dénia could have suspected I had this money until 2009 when a friend may have seen a church service program I kept in my living room dresser. But to have extrapolated from seeing that to knowing about compensation payouts would have been a fair stretch.
    - Nevertheless, honey-trappers knew about this money (which I spent a long time ago, and wisely in my view).
    - During vicious cyber-stalking activity, the hackers mentioned this money and where it came from on a few occasions.
    - How did the criminal honey-trap gangs of Dénia know I had money?
    - Do they hack every visitor who comes into the area to live to check how much money people have?

- Consequently, I met this man David Porter, and, unbelievably and utterly horrifyingly for me, I believe he filmed us having sex with the help of his flatmates who seemed to have a studio set up for that purpose in the next bedroom in their shared house in Stoke Newington, London. 
- His flat mate was grinning and laughing that laugh as we went into Dave's bedroom, sat in front of two or three monitors. He may have even been rubbing his hands.
- Dave Porter ghosted me immediately afterwards.
- Curiously, although he broke off all communication with me, there was some social media activity for a while afterwards which now, thinking back, was extremely similar to the kind of online stalking I endured in parallel to the in-person gang stalking in Dénia. It was the same intriguing content, trigger words and images, suggestive posts, and weird accounts reaching out to chat. I now wonder if even my 56k modem (my landline) was hacked at that time. It seems likely.
- I informed the Metropolitan Police about Dave Porter and his flatmates anonymously a few months later. It had been less than a year since I had remembered sexual assaults from 1989 where I was drugged and sedated, and I had reported these hideous crimes to the police who did nothing about them, even though all the men I named were known criminals and very likely police informants too. 
- It was too traumatizing to deal with the police directly again at that time. I believe criminal gangs are very aware of this sex offense victim trait.
- I have to ask myself, does information from child victims of rape gangs get shared around with criminal gangs after the police speak to suspects, who they know very well are most likely guilty? 
- Is it possible that certain factions of police (perhaps the porn addict community of police officers) gather information about sex abuse victims? This is certainly [what was happening in Rochdale](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-68300484) and elsewhere. Why not North London too?

## October

- I pop home to see my family.
- While I'm there, one of my friends recommends a healer in Enfield. I can't remember the details but I book an appointment.
- It is table healing, hands gently applied, but I can't remember much more about it.
- Except for one thing.
- After the healing, the healer told me she'd seen something during the session.
- I asked her what.
- She said she saw a brutish Neanderthal-type man following me everywhere I went.
- I thought this was a strange thing to see and promptly didn't think about it again.

## November

### Hazel Smith

- I meet two women in Dénia via the U3A, Sandra and Hazel Smith - mother and daughter (apparently).
- I already knew Sandra from the [spiritualist meetings](2006.md#guardian-soulmates). Sandra was very keen that I meet her daughter; very keen.
- They remind me of two women, a mother and daughter I had seen in a Channel 4 documentary, aired in the 90s, when I was living in London.
- The documentary told the story of a mother and daughter who "befriended" old, wealthy people with dementia, or who were close to death. The women somehow managed to get them to change their wills - with the help of random strangers such as bookshop assistants for example - and then took all their money when they died.
- Adult children of the victims were telling their stories on the documentary and it was appalling and sickening to learn that this sort of thing was actually happening in the world. I was horrified, in fact.
- One of the victims had lived in a North London townhouse, a bit like these.

![Fortress Road Kentish Town](../../content/images/townhouses.png)

- There was a strong suggestion that the targets had been drugged, possibly poisoned, and there was even a suggestion of sexual activity with regards to the male and female victims and the younger woman Hazel. 
- The women secured witnesses for the new wills from sales staff at a local bookstore.
- The documentary went on to say that they had actually been charged, and the case went to crown court. However, they were found not guilty.
- These two women in Dénia were *EXACTLY* like the two on the documentary, even down to the mother's headscarf.
- I'd just got back from a Kabbalah conference in Barcelona (this is how I can date this properly to 2006) when they invited me out to dinner.
- I went along to a restaurant in Dutch alley.
- I was not surprised to hear constant references to them borrowing money, to suggestions they couldn't pay their bills, to them waiting for me to suggest I would help them out.
- I was silent and I did not mention my suspicions.
- Sandra, the mother, was involved in a "situation" with someone in the community she had borrowed money from and it was all a bit of a drama.
- Hazel was talking about how she was sleeping with a married man, a local Spaniard. She told me his name was Paco Sendra.
- I must have shown concern because she told me that it was OK, she had him in his box, and that she puts people in boxes. I had no idea what she meant by this but I assumed she was referring to some psychological technique she used to deal with difficult situations.
- Nevertheless, their behavior and everything they said made me more and more sure that they were who I thought they were.
- Hazel invited me to go out for drinks after the dinner. She had drunk an awful lot, well over a bottle of wine, but nevertheless drove safely to a club at the start of Las Marinas beach in Dénia.
- We drank a fair bit of alcohol. She found two men and we went back to her house with them.
- Hazel Smith, at that time, lived in the Rosaleda II urbanization in the Las Marinas area of Dénia. Currently, a German friend of mine Alex (Alessandra), and her British partner John also live there, people also implicated in the recent gang stalking.
- Hazel disappeared into the bedroom with one of the young men, who may have been Raul Perez, a future English student of mine. Looking back, this man appeared nervous and never spoke, and I wonder now if he was on something.
- Myself and the other fellow left and walked home to our respective houses. The slobberiness of his kiss goodnight when we got to my gate suggested he had been assured of more happening.
- Hazel invited me for an Indian meal a few days later and I accepted.
- She told me things over dinner that suggested she used sex with men to get what she wanted. She mentioned getting off a speeding ticket like this. 
- She told me she had nearly been married once but backed out at the last minute, but not before she'd got a car out of him.
- She asked me did I like the boy she left me with the night we went out, and the suggestion was in a sexual way. I asked her if was she out of her mind. She was shocked.
- I then told her that I had recently remembered serious child sexual abuse and I had reported it to the police and that, at that time, my life was all about healing.
- Her demeanor changed at that moment and she became weirdly angry and aggressive towards me.
- I figured I had hit a nerve with regards to something similar that may have happened to her as a child.

!!! danger "Another interpretation of Hazel's words and anger"
    - Was Hazel's anger actually due to the fact I was clearly unashamed of what had happened to me, and was happy to share the information?
    - Had she planned on exploiting or blackmailing me with the porn videos she had of me at that time?
    - Were all her lack-of-morality examples gaging how easy it would be to get me into situations with men in which I would be vulnerable?

- We paid, and when the waiter brought the change, she threw it at me in a very unpleasant way, as if she was disgusted!
- She then asked me back to hers for a drink and a smoke. 
- I agreed. I did not smoke pot, but I had a few puffs. She explained she was a pot addict.
- She gave me a drink and soon after I started to feel extremely woozy and heavy.
- We were listening to Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd and I remember singing along a little.
- At some point she declared loudly I was to get up from my chair, she was taking me home.
- I dragged myself up, and staggered speechless into her car, with her help, and she drove me to my apartment building. She leaned over me to open the door from inside the car and told me to "get out" loudly. She may have pushed me. She may have had to push me.
- I managed to get out of the car and into my flat and into the bathroom.
- I probably vomited.
- I then lay on the cold tile floor, completely still, unable to move or speak, for about 6 hours. 
- It was winter and I believe the vomiting and the cold tiles kept me alive.
- I knew that I had been sedated with an extremely strong drug or anaesthetic.
- It was horrifying and overwhelming. I was unable to go to the police about it.
- I made excuses in an email, pretending I was concerned about how much I was drinking, and I never saw her again. 
- Well, I did see her one other time, in passing. She was standing up and reading a magazine at the Carrio bar in the Calle Diana one morning when I was walking past. This is the sort of thing I know now that stalkers might do to "present" themselves to their target for some sick and convoluted reason.
- In any case, as I came round from whatever she had given me that November morning, I was 100% sure that Hazel and Sandra Smith were the two I had seen in the documentary, and that they were still active.
- I wondered if having that sort of power over people was addictive.
- It horrified me that Hazel was working as an accountant and financial adviser for British pensioners, and over subsequent years I saw her advertising talks and seminars for the British expat community, via the U3A and similar, on things like how to manage taxes. 
- A few times I saw her on social media she had been listed under a company name, Smith and Sendra.
- When we had been out drinking, Hazel had talked about her time on P&O cruise ships as the ship's accountant and mentioned how it was a "long way down" if you had fallen from deck on those boats. The implication made me shudder.

!!! info "Why am I telling you all this?"
    - There is so much "normalized" sedating and poisoning in Dénia, it seems there must be a connection.
    - In September 2023, when I stubbornly returned to Dénia to continue my piano studies after having been severely terrorized by teachers and staff at the conservatory, the gang stalking got exponentially worse. Specifically, the online stalking on social networks was suddenly delivered in native vernacular English.
    - It was intense and overwhelming; a mix of sexual grooming, hypnosis, NLP suggestion techniques, and threats of violence and murder.
    - Furthermore, the illicit drugging and poisoning that was going on without my knowledge also intensified and exaggerated the emotions triggered by the online content I was seeing; fear, sexual arousal, euphoria, anxiety, on a loop. I can see this now in retrospect.
    - I believe Hazel Smith was involved. Fake accounts that interacted with me knew things only she could know.
    - Certainly the stalkers/hackers mentioned her many times in our bizarre exchanges, and they even created a fake X account with an AI generated profile photo which looks to be a mix of mine and Hazel Smith's face. Note the name: "Connie".
    <br/><br/>
    ![Mine and Hazel Smith's face AIed together](../../content/images/fake-accounts/Screenshot%202024-03-08%20at%2008.34.35.png)

!!! danger "In retrospect"
    - Writing this statement has brought a lot of old memories to the surface.
    - I wonder if, while at dinner with Sandra and Hazel in 2006, they managed to turn the conversation around to me playing the piano, and I can hear Hazel saying at that moment, "Oh, Domingo plays the piano doesn't he?" to Sandra, who then told her to shush.
    - I then asked who's Domingo and they said oh just someone we know.
    - If this memory is true, then it is likely I was targeted long before I mentioned the sexual abuse to Hazel and they already had their conspiracy planned out.
    - The criminals of Dénia, Domingo the piano teacher, his family and friends, the trumpet teacher, and the online hackers, always have a habit of informing you about what they're doing long before you could possibly know about it.
    - I believe they get a sick little kick out of that.
    - Had the Metropolitan police found child rape-gang porn footage of me and if so, why would they not make arrests?
    - How did the criminal gangs of Dénia know about the porn and get access to it, and from whom?
    - Did those criminal gangs conspire to reenact the rape-gang's crimes while live-streaming me on porn networks from my apartment?

- I had previously thought this had happened in 2007, but I realized that was too late - see earlier commits.
- There's no reason Hazel Smith would have waited over a year to meet me; she'd have wanted to get her hands on my Lockerbie compensation money as soon as she could as I was spending it quickly on travel and healing.

## Rewards offered

- I have no doubt that footage will come to light now as it must have gone around to many, many people over the last 35 years.
- I'm currently offering a substantial reward for any files of pedophile rape-gang porn where the offenders will be predominantly black males.
- I'm also offering rewards for any Dénia, sedated or otherwise, spy-cam porn from my flat or my hacked devices.
- I'm emotionally and psychologically prepared to see all of it; thanks, ironically, to spending 3 years in the psycho-sexual-emotional warfare trenches of Dénia. 
- I believe that women who stand up to sexual abusers with the boldness and courage that comes from full knowledge that they are innocent, like Gisele Pelicot did in 2024, can heal the world.
