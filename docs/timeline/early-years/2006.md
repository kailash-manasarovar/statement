### Reporting child sexual abuse to the Metropolitan Police

- I go with my mother to Highgate courthouse building to report the child sexual abuse I had remembered during a therapy session that took place in December 2005.
- It was videoed.
- I remembered one instance of being gang raped by a grooming gang that had targeted me in North London when I was 16 in 1989.
- Remembering this was very traumatizing for me.
- I also remembered other peripheral details, like a man with a black case, which I believed was a video VHS camera although didn't remember seeing it.
- At the time, I was studying for my PhD at the technology department of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid.
- I lived in Madrid.
- I found it extremely difficult to be among people at the university.
