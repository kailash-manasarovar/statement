!!! tip "Why so much information?"
    - The early years information is related to current events in a number of ways:
        1. The criminal activity I have encountered is perpetrated by honey trap gangs who, by definition, are in it for long game rewards.
        2. People I encountered in those earlier years play significant roles later on.
        3. It's essential for the reader to understand my state of mind in order to understand some of the later events and my reaction to them.
        4. Describing some of the more sinister psychological traps the criminal gangs inflict on the unwary via social media may be helpful to parents, guardians, and perhaps even law enforcement agencies trying to understand how criminal networks, or vast networks of what we used to call "perverts", or sex offenders, have managed to control and manipulate huge numbers of children and young people by targeting them in similar ways.

### Reporting child sexual abuse to the Metropolitan Police

- I go with my mother to Highgate courthouse building to report the child sexual abuse I had remembered during a therapy session that took place in December 2005.
- The interview, with one detective from Hornsey Metropolitan Police, was recorded by a woman PC.
- I had remembered one instance of being drugged and gang raped by a grooming gang that had targeted me in North London when I was 16 in 1989.
- Remembering this was very traumatizing.
- I also remembered other smaller peripheral details at that time; such as, for example, a man with a black case, which I believed, and said, was a video VHS camera although I didn't remember seeing it.
- At the time of this interview, I was studying for my PhD at the technology department of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid and I lived in Madrid.
- I suffered from re-traumatized PTSD and I found it extremely difficult to be among people at the university and elsewhere.

!!! info "Why is this important?"
    - I believe the child sexual abuse I experienced at the hands of North London grooming gangs in 1989 to be the foundation of everything that has been happening to me in Dénia more recently.
    - I believe the porn gangs of Dénia found out about what happened to me via hacking, and have even tracked down the various porn films taken of me being raped as a child in 1989.
    - I believe now that the gang stalking I endured at the hands of teachers and staff at the conservatory masked something much more sinister.
    - I believe that my abuse history and the recordings taken from online voyeurism have been monetized by the porn gangs of Dénia, and I also believe that their true intention was to somehow recreate what I had suffered in 1989 for the enjoyment of rape porn addicts the world over.
