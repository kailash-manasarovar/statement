## Leon, a man I worked for

- An example of hacking and constant sabotage of everything I do?
- Would [Mike Wenham](2010.md#mike-wenham) have been involved?
- Did the UK porn distributors and honey-trappers team up with Mike Wenham?
- Was he their first true test of whether they could use online lust and porn triggers to manipulate someone into undergoing extremely risky genital surgeries and then murdering a person?
- Was another *test*, as it were, Lorraine's daughter?
- Did the trans ideology manipulation software, aimed mainly at children, girls usually, get released soon after these successful outcomes?
- Can we tie it all back to a small town in Spain?

## Tiferet 

- In early May I visit Israel and take a 7-day Holy Land tour.
- I fall in love with the country, in a million different ways.
- During our visit to Jerusalem, we stopped at a square which I always called Tiferet Square.

- It's not really called that, but kind of.
- Anyway.
- As we walked up to the square, back then in 2012, I could hear music.
- Two buskers, a female keyboard player and a male instrumentalist, possibly a trumpeter, I'm not yet sure; they were playing [*Bésame Mucho*](https://youtu.be/BueVGiyx_E4).

- I became entranced.
- The reason I remember this so well is because I didn't listen to music at the time and I had the song in my head for weeks after.
- I told our tour guide, and a few others since, that I want to live on Tiferet Street close to the Hurva Synagogue, which resurrects, periodically.

- I still want to live there.
- Why did I tell you this story?
- You tell me.

## Passeig Periodista Ramon Ortega

- I move back to Denia in October.
- I have had severe colitis since I moved back to London the previous September.
- For a whole year I have been bleeding from my bottom, badly.
- I'm back in Denia for about a week when I notice it has completely cleared up.
- Prior to moving back, I did a colonic fast and cleanse in Thailand.
- I rent a flat in Las Rotas initially, but the woman has lied to me about their being sufficient internet so I have no option but to find somewhere else.
- I find a flat in Passeig Periodista Ramon Ortega.
- By the way, my mother has all the full addresses somewhere, I can't be bothered to look.

- The size and layout is exactly like this flat: https://www.idealista.com/en/inmueble/109473972/.
- Zoe visited quite a lot as we were both writing books and exchanging notes.
- One afternoon, I remember she started talking about the Pakistani rape gangs out of the blue in my sitting room. I found it a bit weird. I wasn't thinking about it.
- My dad also visited at Fallas time in 2013 and stayed about a week.
- I wonder about that visit. Did someone approach us in the Irish bar?
- The only reason I have to be suspicious about my stay here - which I loved - was that I had extremely bad genital boils.
- I remember because I would burst them sometimes and they would stain the wall opposite with blood and pus. They were *really* angry.
- Does this mean I was being sedated and raped in my apartment here too?
- I'm not sure.
- I do know that the woman who moved in downstairs looked a fair bit like the [sedated woman I saw on Denia TV](2008.md#denia-tv) in 2008, enough to make me do a double take when I met her.

## The Liar

- On 21st December 2012, I finish my first book, [The Liar](https://www.amazon.com/Liar-Niramisa-Weiss-ebook/dp/B00CA5F602), inspired by my visit to the Western Wall in May of this year.
