# 2011

all wip...

## Gammadian Freeman & his mate

- India/Spain post Jitendra wip
- We visited Parmath Niketan and Char Dam together in 2011. 
- I had met him on a Cleargreen conference in Barcelona in 2008 or 2009 maybe.
- Elke was there.
- He made a beeline for me and *pushed his way in*.
- An older woman got between us and protected me from him and he left me alone but had my contact details.
- I don't think anything was going on in Barcelona that time cos I was sharing accommodation with a bunch of women so they would all have to have been sedated along with me.
- It is possible, however, because the "accommodation" was normal apartments with the owners living there.
- This was when Eli got a little heart out of the blue and I met Lydie for a vegetarian meal and she noticed it.
- Gammadian *assumed* a romantic relationship with me, but never once asked me if I was interested.
- It was very difficult and he got extremely angry with me when it was obvious I wasn't interested.
- He was very rude, in fact.
- He brought his pothead mate with him on Char Dam and they sat in the car and got high the whole time, it was embarrassing.
- They never asked the driver if it was OK and he was too polite to complain.
- The next year, he set his Spanish mate Santi from Madrid up to pretend he liked me and visit me in London (the reason I know that's what they do).
- But given it was after Jitendra, and they were all druggies, ... worth a look maybe.

## Roberto from Alicante & Catalina

- She (from Toronto) got pregnant really quickly and moved to Alicante.
- They visited me.
- I spent New Year's with them 2012.
- I mentioned to her I was struggling with csa trauma.
- One of his family was at Poolsawat in December 2024 and I mentioned it on X.. so nice to see people I know..
- Gitanos, not Catalina she was from Chile but her father was Jewish.
