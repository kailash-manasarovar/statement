# 2011

- After the [devastating experience with Mike Wenham](2010.md#mike-wenham) which heralded the beginning of the nearly-complete destruction of my professional career as a developer, I realize I would benefit from an extended trip to India.
- I spend 6 months in India from March to September, then a month in Thailand before returning home.

!!! tip "What I did in India?"
    - I attend a [Sivananda yoga teacher training course](https://sivananda.org.in/neyyardam/) in Kerala.
    - I then spend two weeks in Rishikesh at [Parmarth Niketan](https://parmarth.org/) on a yoga course, then go on to make the Char Dham pilgrimage by private car.
    - I spend a month in Dharamsala doing Buddhist meditation practices, mainly Vipasana, then I return to Rishikesh for more intense yoga courses at Parmarth.
    - After this I spend a few weeks at an ashram near Rishikesh run by a follower of Sri Aurobindo who is, thankfully, away traveling when I visit.
    - I then do an Iyengar course in Dehradun at the [Yog Ganga centre](https://www.yog-ganga.com/centre/) before heading to Thailand for fasting practices.

## Gammadian Freeman & his mate

- Something had made me sign up to [Jitendra's course online](2010.md#why-i-decided-to-be-celibate-for-the-rest-of-my-life) again early in the year.
- I believe now this was likely online manipulation again.
- I even sent him some money; about 400 euros.
- Something makes me realize I've made a massive mistake, and I ask him to return the money to me.
- I meet a man in Finsbury Park, London, who practices Tensegrity like my German friend from Dénia.
- I met him previously at a course in Barcelona in 2008 or 2009; Richard.
- He made a beeline for me on the course, and *pushed his way in*, as they do.
- Interestingly, an older woman got between us and distracted him, and he left me alone in Barcelona after that, but he got my contact details and we stayed in touch.
- He texted me unusually once, at a significant moment, which surprised me.
- I wonder about that now...
- At the Barcelona Cleargreen retreat, I was sharing accommodation with a bunch of women.
- If I had been sedated and raped there, my roommates would all have been sedated along with me.
- It is possible, I guess, because the "accommodation" was normal apartments with the owners living there alongside us; not that difficult for the dedicated porn-gangs to have organized.
- This was the same trip that my little elephant Eli suddenly had a little heart printed on his chest, out of the blue. It was rather peculiar.
- I met [Lydie](2005.md#womens-retreat-with-sat-santokh) for a vegetarian meal, and introduced her to Eli (who I carried everywhere with me) and she noticed it first.
- Anyway, this Richard fellow, a Londoner, calls himself [Gammadian Freeman](https://openwing.weebly.com/about.html).
- We become friends and, coincidentally I assume, he is also going to India at the same time as me in 2011.
- I tell him what my plans are and he joins.
- We both stay at Parmarth Niketan and do the two-week yoga course there.
- He comes with me to help me get my money back off Jitendra.
- He tells the guru at Parmarth that he's personal friends with the Dalai Lama.
- He's exaggerating a connection his Cleargreen teachers had *once* with the Dalai Lama and he wasn't even there! I've no idea this is all going on...
- After the course, we go on the Char Dam pilgrimage. 
- I started to think about the pilgrimage during the course and didn't really want to be traveling alone in India.
- I ask Richard he if would like to accompany me and he agrees.
- We rent a taxi who drives us to Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath over 11 days.
- It's spectacular!
- Richard has *assumed* a romantic relationship with me, but he never once asked me if I was interested in him or spoke to me about it at all.
- I was not giving him any signs apart from being friendly with him.
- It was very difficult, and he got extremely angry with me when it became obvious to him I wasn't interested.
- He was very rude towards me, in fact.
- He brought his pothead mate with him on Char Dam and they sat in the car and got high the whole time.
- It was embarrassing.
- They never asked the driver if it was OK to smoke pot in the car, and the driver was too polite to complain.
- The following year, Richard's Spanish mate Santiago from Madrid, another Cleargreen student, turned up in London kind of pretending he liked me, but didn't; the Spanish game of *get the woman back who rejected your mate*.
- This is interesting to me now because Richard played a weird game of not actually revealing his intentions, keeping me guessing, and then suddenly buying me a gift out of the blue which I tried not to accept.
- I said; "I don't deserve this", after he passed me the necklace.
- I meant he shouldn't have given me the gift, it was not deserved.
- He replied as if he was offended and my words meant that I thought he was too good for me.
- It was all very bizarre.
- I have to wonder if the whole thing was a set up, given Santi's role, and given the proximity to Dénia to prep me for the planned switcheroo.
- We know they're very, very long gamers, after all.

## Roberto from Alicante & Catalina

- She (from Toronto) got pregnant really quickly and moved to Alicante.
- They visited me.
- I spent New Year's with them 2012.
- I mentioned to her I was struggling with csa trauma.
- One of his family was at Poolsawat in December 2024 and I mentioned it on X.. so nice to see people I know..
- Gitanos, not Catalina she was from Chile but her father was Jewish.
