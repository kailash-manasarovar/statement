## Warrior in the Heart

- As part of my healing process, I study shamanism in Glastonbury UK with the [Warrior in the Heart](https://www.facebook.com/warriorintheheart/) organization run by Howard & Elsa Malpas.
- It's a year long course, and we meet four times in Glastonbury.
- The group is small; about seven women and two men.
- One of the men seems extremely out of place; Richard.
- He tells us he has just got out of prison for cocaine trafficking and he's looking for a wife.
- The first statement seemed reasonable, the second less so as he ended up bedding a good few of the ladies on the course. 
- Not me, by the way, but he was inordinately interested in me.
- He took me out to dinner and asked me if got my money from prostitution. I was mortified and really angry actually.
- He then suggested I had come into my wealth during the `.com` boom.
- I told him I loved him.
- At one of our meetings, in August, he suggested I have a threesome with him and his lady friend from nearby who looked a bit like Lady Diana. 
- He was getting annoying.
- One morning, doing yoga, he just came out with it. "Where did you get your money?"
- I told him; "international terrorism", which was true.
- He giggled and said, "I expect you did."
- Later, he persuaded me to go to an all night festival with him in Cheddar Gorge, the Big Green Gathering; one of the other participants was going to be there running a chai caf√©.
- I had a dreadful chest infection, but went along anyway.
- After arriving, I just got sicker and sicker. I was running a temperature, and I had to lie down.
- I knew I might get pneumonia if I had to sleep in a field.
- I told Richard I was going to have to leave, and asked him if he wouldn't mind taking me to somewhere I could pick up a taxi and go to a hotel.
- He was furious.
- I demanded he do so; it would take him 30 minutes max and he'd be back at the festival.
- In the end, weirdly, we both left the festival for the night.
- He drove us back to his house in Bristol and he gave me his bed to sleep in while he slept on the couch.
- On the way back to his in the car, he was having a bit of a rant.
- I remember he kept saying; "I'm not scared of the Adam's family."
- I had no idea what he was going on about.
- Now, maybe I do.
- Years later Howard, Elsa, and I remembered him. We all remarked on what hard work he was.
- I rather liked him. He was definitely a character.
