## Dénia

- I had planned a trip to Egypt in December but my flat got bedbugs
- Instead I changed all my plans and spent most of December in Dénia
- I stayed at two hotels and logged into their networks
- I did a lot of apartment searches
- On December 8th, a very significant day for me spiritually, an apartment came up for rent which was perfect, too good to be true even
- I contacted the landlady and signed the agreement
- The landlady, Beatriz ..., was very angry with me for some reason
- I moved in on December 15th

## Semen stains on the sofa

- The flat didn't seem to have been lived in properly for a while
- The water ran brown in the bathtub
- There was untold rubbish in the kitchen cupboards which I cleaned out
- There were semen stains on the sofa; I thought because it had been used as an AirBNB type property and the last visitors had been *you know what*
- The landlady, the caretaker Pedro, and my neighbour Marie Carmen at number 16 talked about a woman renting the flat previously and running away without saying why. She was a nurse at the Dénia hospital

!!! important
    I believe the references to the nurse also relate to a woman they have more recently been posting on Twitter who is clearly about to do porn - with or without her knowledge - and is often dressed as a nurse.

## Walking

- I met Christine BJ to go hiking on the mountain and was invited to go walking with the English ladies once I returned in February

## Back to France

- I went back to France end of December to finalise the flat there
