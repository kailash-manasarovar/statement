## Too-good-to-be-true on the 8th December

- I had planned a trip to Egypt in December for Christmas but my flat in Lourdes got serious bedbugs about three weeks before I was due to leave.
- I changed all my plans and spent most of December in Dénia instead.
- I stayed at two hotels and logged into their networks.
- I had been doing a lot of apartment searches since August and had found nothing at all.
- On December 8th, however, a very significant day for me spiritually, while I was in Dénia, an apartment came up for rent which was perfect; too good to be true even.
- Carrer Furs 15, Bloque 1 Escalera 2 Piso 3 Apartamento 17, Dénia 03700 Alicante.
- I contacted the landlady, Beatriz Garcia Morales, and signed the agreement.
- Beatriz and her husband run a local architects company: [QB arquitectos](https://qbarquitectos.com/). 
- The landlady, Beatriz, was angry with me, and disagreeable.
- She barked at me when I said; *I hope I'm not going to regret this*, as I signed the lease, having reservations based on her demeanor.
- Hackers recently mentioned her grumpy demeanor online to me over the summer in 2024 in a, as usual, derogatory manner.
- Was she angry about having to essentially be involved in murdering a woman? Had it happened before in her apartment? What happened to the previous tenant, the nurse, she was constantly talking about? Are all the properties her company is involved with fitted with high-res spy-cam systems streaming directly to porn-networks?
- I signed the [rental contract](../../content/documents/contracto/rental-contract.pdf) and moved in on December 15th.

### Death clause

- There is a clause in the rental contract about what happens if I were to die in the flat prior to termination of the lease.
- It appears to relieve the owner of all indemnity enforced by Spanish law.
- For a contract with an initial term of 1 year, this seems a little strange, sinister even.
- I have never seen a clause like that in a rental contract before and I have read a great many.
- Did someone get caught up in a legal situation previously in a case of a targeted person who did not have a clause like this in their rental contract?

### Keys

- She only gave me one key, of a set of four, and there was a bit of a drama about where the other keys were which seemed contrived.
- I didn't trust Beatriz Garcia Morales and, from her weird behavior and manner, I felt it likely she would enter my apartment without my knowledge.
- A few days later I suspected someone had been in without my knowledge.
- I got the locks changed soon after by a British locksmith Carl Barclay.
- Even so, I believe people were entering my house whenever I was not there on a regular basis the whole time I lived there. It's not clear how they got entry after I changed the locks. I guess that would be a simple matter for a criminal gang.

### Rent

!!! danger "Who has been receiving my rent payments?"
    - The landlady changed the account I pay rent to twice in three years.
    - I paid rent to three different accounts in three year's of tenancy.
    - I don't believe all these accounts are hers and I suspect that finding out who in fact owns these accounts may be very enlightening to law enforcement.

## Something not right with the air-conditioning unit

- I quickly noticed that the heating was sub-optimal, it didn't seem to have power and it never heated the rooms up properly.
- When I tried the cold setting, it was working very well and indeed in summer the cold setting was great.
- I complained to Beatrice, and her mum and dad (the sailor), who had met me and shown me the property initially.
- By the way, her mum and dad had *apparently* been living in an apartment in the same complex in the other building but I never saw them again in the building after moving in.
- Could they have been more actors brought in to make me feel better about the place given Bea was so unbelievably unpleasant and angry about something.
- I also mentioned the air to Pedro the caretaker.
- Bea was very annoyed about this, and sent me the invoice for the *completely new unit* she had just put in just the year before.
- Remember. The bathwater was running brown in this flat, the boiler eventually nearly blows up a year later, and the appliances were ancient.
- The fridge looked to be about thirty years old.
- The cooker didn't work either and had to be replaced.
- Also, I could smell my neighbors smoke in my bedroom and I complained about that too.
- I blocked up the air conditioning vent because of it.
- Anyway, it was cold and it was winter time.
- Bea sends the air-conditioning people to have a look.
- They're angry too.
- A man comes with a boy.
- He has a look, literally presses a button or two, says nothing's wrong, and leaves.
- They were from a big company in the area with labels vans, I will remember the name.

## Semen stains on the sofa

- When I moved in, the flat didn't seem to have been lived in properly for a while.
- The water ran brown in the bathtub. The boiler was so old it broke down a year later and had to be replaced.
- There was untold rubbish in the kitchen cupboards which I cleaned out.
- There were semen stains on the sofa. 
- At the time, I thought the semen stains were because the apartment had probably been used as an AirBNB type property and the visitors may have been on romantic weekends. It was disgusting though and I cleaned it off.
- The landlady, her parents, the caretaker at the time Pedro, and my elderly neighbor Marie Carmen at number 16 kept telling me about a woman who rented the flat just before me, and ran away shortly after without saying why. 
- She was apparently a nurse at the Dénia hospital and may have been called Sonia Ortiz.

!!! important "Fake accounts referring to the nurse"
    - Cyber-gang stalkers, more recently, posted a lot of references via fake accounts on Twitter to nurses.
    - Women in fake accounts are often dressed up as nurses and in poses which are clearly going to be pornographic and quite often obviously filmed without the knowledge of the woman.
    - The following fake account came up in my mentions sometime in the summer of 2024.

    ![The nurse profile pic](../../content/images/fake-accounts/nurse1.png)

    - Note the threatening statement, a common characteristic of the cyber-stalking I have been enduring since June 2023.

    ![The nurse profile](../../content/images/fake-accounts/nurse2.png)

    - Fake accounts like these may have one or two posts, or specific messages in the profile itself, or in the top few posts below the profile.

- I wonder if the nurse left hurriedly because she realized she was being drugged and related it to something in the apartment.
- The email address of the previous tenant may be `sonyaortyz@hotmail.com`.

## Christmas 

### Chinese

- Christine invites me for a Chinese on Christmas Day. A bunch of the expats are there.

- They invite me to go walking with them every weekend. I'm delighted.
- Patricia is there with a black curly-haired younger man in a kaftan. I wonder if it is her husband.

![Patricia and her husband](../../content/images/p-and-dodgy-bloke-1.PNG)

- She's keen I join the choir she's a member of that meet once a week but I'm not ready for that level of social activity. 
- A couple of the expat-Anglophones offer me available apartments they own, or they are looking after as power of attorney, and they suggest I might like to buy them. 

## Feeling unwell

- While I'm in my new apartment, I start to feel unwell.
- I vomit on a few occasions after a couple of glasses of wine. I also feel extremely woozy after drinking wine in my apartment.
- Nothing has changed in my drinking patterns and I have not vomited after alcohol in many many years.
- This is the beginning of a pattern of unwellness related to something in my new apartment in Carrer Furs 15, Dénia.
- I don't suspect anything.

## Back to France

- I return to Lourdes at the end of December to finalize the flat there and move to Spain.
