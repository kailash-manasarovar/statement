## Dénia

- I had planned a trip to Egypt in December but my flat in Lourdes got serious bedbugs.
- I changed all my plans and spent most of December in Dénia.
- I stayed at two hotels and logged into their networks.
- I did a lot of apartment searches and found nothing at all.
- On December 8th, a very significant day for me spiritually, an apartment came up for rent which was perfect; too good to be true even.
- Carrer Furs 15, Bloque 1 Escalera 2 Piso 3 Apartamento 17, Dénia 03700 Alicante
- I contacted the landlady, Beatriz Garcia Morales, and signed the agreement
- The landlady, Beatriz, was angry and disagreeable.
- I signed the contract and moved in on December 15th. A copy of the signed contract will be posted in due course.

!!! danger "The rental contract"
    - Something weird I noticed at the time was there was a clause in the rental contract about what would happen to my belongings if I were to die in the flat.
    - It gave me cause to wonder.
    - I have never seen a clause like that in a rental contract before and I have read a great many.

- She only gave me one key, of a pack of four, and there was a bit of a drama about where the other keys were which seemed contrived.
- I didn't trust Beatriz Garcia Morales and, from her weird behavior and manner, I felt it likely she would enter my apartment without my knowledge.
- A few days later I suspected someone had been in without my knowledge.
- I got the locks changed soon after.

!!! info "Who has been receiving my rent payments?"
    - Beatriz has changed the account I pay rent to twice now.
    - I have paid rent to three different accounts.
    - I don't believe all these accounts are hers and I suspect that finding out who in fact owns these accounts may be very enlightening.
        - ES7320950444909122412071
        - ES1201280601880100047345
        - ES6800865106190015755620

## Semen stains on the sofa

- When I moved in, the flat didn't seem to have been lived in properly for a while.
- The water ran brown in the bathtub. The boiler was so old it broke down a year later and had to be replaced.
- There was untold rubbish in the kitchen cupboards which I cleaned out.
- There were semen stains on the sofa. At the time, I thought it was because it had been used as an AirBNB type property and the visitors may have been visiting on romantic weekends. It was disgusting though and I cleaned it off.
- The landlady, the caretaker at the time Pedro, and my neighbor Marie Carmen at number 16 talked about a woman renting the flat previously and running away shortly after without saying why. She was a nurse at the Dénia hospital.

!!! important
    - I believe the references to the nurse also relate to a woman the gang stalkers have more recently been posting on Twitter in poses which are clearly going to be pornographic - filmed with or without her knowledge. She is often dressed as a nurse.
    - The following fake account was posted sometime in the summer of 2024.

    - Note the threatening statement, a common characteristic of the cyber-stalking I have been enduring.

    - Fake accounts like these may have one or two posts, messages in the profile itself, or in the top posts below the profile.

- I wonder if she left hurriedly because she realized she was being drugged and related it to the apartment in some ways.

## Walking

- I met Christine BJ to go hiking on the mountain and she invited me to go walking with the English ladies on a regular basis once I returned in February.

## Back to France

- I went back to France end of December to finalize the flat there.
