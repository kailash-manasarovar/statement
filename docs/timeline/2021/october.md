## ConsenSys

!!! tip "Work in progress"
    - This section is a work-in-progress first, sketchy draft.

- I get an amazing online role with ConsenSys and I work for them from October 2021 to October 2022 but, again, I'm immediately surrounded by a lot of men, and some women, who appear to loathe me.
- Somehow, they seem to know about my online terfing activities - which they absolutely shouldn't - and it feels like I'm being bullied on the basis that I have unwelcome opinions about drag queens in schools, etc...
- I spoke not at all about these things to anyone!
- I believe my political views (which no-one should have known about) is the justification for a female manager stealing an excellent presentation I created - on the basis I would be giving it - and gave it herself! Then told me she had!
- I find myself in an impossible situation, right from the start, which I respond to in a rational and self-assertive way while the male colleague involved tantrums - no exaggeration.
- I'm then bullied by the wider team, ostensibly for my response to the tantruming Frenchman.
- I'm then ignored completely by all the teams I'm working for - I take a side role contract with another firm for about four months so that I don't go mad with boredom.
- There is also the fact that [I whistle-blew about Qredo](march.md#qredo) who were working very closely with one of the ConsenSys teams I worked with; what else could I do?
- I don't understand how people can know so much evil is going on and just ignore it. For me, not doing anything about it actually causes me visceral pain!
 - The men that are bullying me stop giving me work, and whenever they do give me some they take the opportunity to have another go, tantrum-styley.
- My *bad* name spreads out; probably that I'm a *difficult transphobe, a Karen* or something similar.
- My manager is pretty decent and is obviously on my side, but only as much as he can be.
- I do get more work with other parts of the business, specifically Infura, which is really great and I enjoy but, again, I feel I am not particularly welcome although it's much much better than core ConsenSys teams.
- Curiously, (I think) I see a man I'm working closely with in ConsenSys Infura out walking in the Pyrenees (August 2022)... I know he's from nearby in France so I'm not totally surprised. We don't speak. 
- I'm now *a bit more* surprised about that. I'd remember his name if I heard it.
- I move to Dénia while I'm working for ConsenSys.
- What I want to highlight today is that, while I was working for them and living at Carrer Furs, even before this, I was being manipulated online with *strong* romantic ideas about Lubin, and very specifically the offsite that he was planning for the whole business!
- I can pinpoint exactly when this manipulation started; it was while I was staying at the Port Dénia hotel in December 2021 waiting to move into my new apartment at Carrer Furs and working online in the hotel.
- The offsite never took place, for some reason, thank God.
- Once cancelled, the romantic ideas I was having about Lubin stopped - they were fundamentally connected to this offsite and the thought I'd meet him in person.
- So weird and sinister.
- I wonder if that was when the (criminal-porn-subscriber) bullying started to ramp up, so they could get me to leave and go somewhere else so I could attend a different offsite.
- Interesting, isn't it.

## Going no-contact

- Something loving suggested I go no-contact with my family in October 2021 and I did so. 
- It felt amazing, liberating.
- I realized I was getting boils with even just the thought of my parents phoning me.
- Going no contact made me feel I could breathe again; like I didn't have to compensate for other people's lack of empathy (at best) towards victims of sexual violence anymore.
- I was no contact with my family from then until April 2024, nearly 3 years.
- It was only when teachers and staff at the conservatory of Dénia made me fear for my life, in March 2024, that I contacted them again, in two hand-written letters (so the hackers would not see them) that explained I had been targeted by Domingo the piano teacher and his associates and family, and I was afraid they were going to murder me.
- My family and I were in contact shortly after that over the phone.

!!! tip "Isolating victims of gender violence"
    - Gender violence involves isolating targets from any possible support networks.
    - In my case, I was already fully isolated when I arrived in Dénia, an abuser's dream.
    - I never once felt isolated or alone, however.
    - The criminals will be very aware that I have a strong spiritual practice. However, they must be atheists, or perhaps they believe God hates women as much as they do, especially abused ones; a foolish stance for a believer.
