## Going no-contact

- Something suggested I go no contact with my family in October 2021 and I did so. 
- It felt amazing, liberating.
- I realized I was getting boils with even just the thought of my parents phoning me.
- Going no contact made me feel like I could breathe again.
- I was no contact with my family from then until April 2024, nearly 3 years.
- It was only when teachers and staff at the conservatory of DÃ©nia made me fear for my life, in March 2024, that I contacted them again, in two hand-written letters that explained I had been targeted by Dominic the piano teacher and his associates and family and I was afraid they were going to murder me.
- We got in contact shortly after over the phone.
