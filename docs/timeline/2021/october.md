## ConsenSys

!!! tip "Work in progress"
    - This section is a work-in-progress first sketchy draft.

- I get an amazing online role with ConsenSys but again I'm surrounded by a lot of men, and some women, who appear to loathe me.
- I move to Denia while I'm working for ConsenSys.
- Somehow, they all seem to know about my online terfing activities - which they absolutely shouldn't - and I'm bullied on the basis that I have unwelcome opinions about drag queens in schools, etc...
- I spoke not at all about these things to anyone.
- I also find myself in impossible situations, right from the start, which I respond to in a rational and self-assertive way while my male colleagues involved tantrum - no exaggeration.
- I'm then bullied by the wider team, ostensibly for my responses to tantruming Frenchmen.
- I'm then ignored completely by the teams I'm working for - I take a side role contract with another firm for about four months so that I don't go mad with boredom.
 - The men that are bullying me totally stop giving me work, and whenever they do give me some they take the opportunity to have another go, tantrum-style.
- My bad name spreads out.
- I do get more work with other parts of the business, specifically Infura, which is great but, again, I am not particularly welcome although it's much much better than core ConsenSys teams.
- Curiously, (I think) I see a man I work for in ConsenSys out walking in the Pyrenees (August 2022)... I know he's from nearby in France so I'm not totally surprised. We don't speak. I'm now a bit more surprised about that.
- I start looking for another role in August.
- I will detail this section in full at some point... just to say, for me, it felt like I was unable to speak at all without people becoming angry at me. Meanwhile, I'm in meetings where men behave in extraordinarily aggressive ways to each other. I know that if I behaved like that I'd be out the door in an eye-blink. The silencing is difficult to deal with; not knowing what I can or can't say without someone getting upset.
- What I want to highlight now is that, while I was working for them and living at Carrer Furs, in March/April 2022, I was being manipulated online with strong romantic ideas about Lubin, and very specifically the offsite that he was planning for the whole business!
- The offsite never took place, for some reason, thank God.
- The romantic ideas I was having about him just disappeared, I didn't even notice.
- I remember now.
- Interesting, isn't it.

## Going no-contact

- Something loving suggested I go no-contact with my family in October 2021 and I did so. 
- It felt amazing, liberating.
- I realized I was getting boils with even just the thought of my parents phoning me.
- Going no contact made me feel I could breathe again; like I didn't have to compensate for other people's lack of empathy (at best) towards victims of sexual violence anymore.
- I was no contact with my family from then until April 2024, nearly 3 years.
- It was only when teachers and staff at the conservatory of Dénia made me fear for my life, in March 2024, that I contacted them again, in two hand-written letters (so the hackers would not see them) that explained I had been targeted by Domingo the piano teacher and his associates and family, and I was afraid they were going to murder me.
- My family and I were in contact shortly after that over the phone.

!!! tip "Isolating victims of gender violence"
    - Gender violence involves isolating targets from any possible support networks.
    - In my case, I was already fully isolated when I arrived in Dénia, an abuser's dream.
    - I never once felt isolated or alone, however.
    - The criminals will be very aware that I have a strong spiritual practice. However, they must be atheists, or perhaps they believe God hates women as much as they do, especially abused ones; a foolish stance for a believer.
