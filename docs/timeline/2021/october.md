## Going no-contact

- Something loving suggested I go no-contact with my family in October 2021 and I did so. 
- It felt amazing, liberating.
- I realized I was getting boils with even just the thought of my parents phoning me.
- Going no contact made me feel I could breathe again; like I didn't have to compensate for other people's lack of empathy (at best) towards victims of sexual violence anymore.
- I was no contact with my family from then until April 2024, nearly 3 years.
- It was only when teachers and staff at the conservatory of Dénia made me fear for my life, in March 2024, that I contacted them again, in two hand-written letters (so the hackers would not see them) that explained I had been targeted by Domingo the piano teacher and his associates and family, and I was afraid they were going to murder me.
- My family and I were in contact shortly after that over the phone.

!!! tip "Isolating victims of gender violence"
    - Gender violence involves isolating targets from any possible support networks.
    - In my case, I was already fully isolated when I arrived in Dénia, an abuser's dream.
    - I never felt isolated or alone, however.
    - The criminals will be very aware that I have a strong spiritual practice. However, they must be atheists, or perhaps they believe God hates women as much as they do, especially abused ones; a foolish stance for a believer.
