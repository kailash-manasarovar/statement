## ConsenSys

- I get an amazing online role with ConsenSys and I work for them from October 2021 to October 2022 but, again, I'm immediately surrounded by a lot of men, and some women, who appear to loathe me.

### Set up, for sport, again

- I'm hired as the lead technical writer for department A (Codefi) where I will build and manage their numerous documentation sites (some of which they already have but mostly will be new).
- As part of my work I'll collaborate with department B (Madeline's department) who already run multiple documentation sites.
- I will use the same docs platform they use.
- Madeline's department has been running documentation systems for years. They're extremely efficient and all their systems are working well.

- It becomes clear to me very quickly that Nicolas (and by extension Madeline's) team expect me to work for them too, as their underling and as a new colleague. 
- I find it extremely strange. They have a lead already. Why would I be OK about working two jobs?
- I meet Byron, their lead early on.
- One of the first things he mentions is how we'll be having an offsite soon.
- I'm a little surprised at this as it is mostly covid lock-down in the world and he and Madeline are based in Australia.
- Byron seems exited about his department's offsite and mentions is multiple time.
- Again, I'm unclear why I would be invited to another department's offsite.
- To add context, there are numerous technical writers all over the business; why invite just me from outside the department?
- It's all very strange and inexplicable and no-one is clear about any of it; what's expected from me with regards to this external team.
- It feels like they're trying to poach me - that's my explanation for it anyway.

### Nicolas 

- Madeline's docs op engineer, Nicolas, reaches out and is of the mind that I will be coming to their department to work for them, for him.
- He schedules meetings that last an hour and talks for two hours and I do not get to speak.
- Nicolas tells me he is a light aircraft pilot in Brittany Northern France; I assume hobbyist.
- He is building a new system for the docs. It's not clear why. They don't need one. Everything's working well.
- Not only that, he is customizing what they have already - an efficient, flexible, and extremely functional platform running multiple websites - into something inflexible, liable to break, and a single-point-of-failure potentially.
- He expects me to use this system for all my work with my department.
- It's unworkable and full of problems; it errors immediately.
- I explain I'm going to use the platform without his customizations until such time as he has fixed all his issues.
- He tantrums.
- I try to reason with him calmly on Slack.
- I tell him I trust him, and I'll let him figure it out, and then we can reconvene, and of course I'll help him with his issues if he needs it.
- He says: *You shouldn't trust anyone!*.
- I'm surprised, but he is tantruming...
- He's actually lost his mind and behaving like an irrational person.
- Remember: this is week two of my role.
- Reluctantly, I talk to my manager about it.
- I tell my manager what has happened.
- My manager does not clear up the problem of a completely external team expecting me to go work for them as well as the job I was hired for.
- I screenshot some of the tantrum including where Nicolas told me I shouldn't trust anyone.
- My manager says: *he shouldn't have said that*.

### Mediation

- I ask for mediation with him.
- This is where I meet Madeline; his boss.
- My manager (can't remember his name yet), Madeline, Nicolas and I meet for mediation on Zoom.
- Nicolas talks. I do not talk.
- Before we begin, he tells us about his wife's depression and how she had to quit her job.
- Nicolas then suggests I'm a disrespectful and rude person, and says a bunch of slightly-offensive things about me personally which are irrelevant to what's happening.
- It's hard for me to say anything. I'm under attack and no-one is standing up for me.
- I write a report about Nicolas' system and how it is unworkable at the current time (my view it is completely unnecessary and will never be workable).

#### Nicolas' system

- I'm just wondering now if the whole thing with this system was to get me to use something that was going to break all the time, and to make sure I was the one to blame for it so I could be in a continued state of stress.
- Was this the *give her a reason for being stressed and anxious* needed to explain any depression and anxiety after sedated off-sites events?
- Was Nicolas apoplectic because I (kind-of) saw the trap before they were able to set it properly?

### The Codefi team and their UI hack

- From here, I'm bullied full-on by nearly everyone.
- I carry on with what I'm doing and build some really cool and efficient sites for the Codefi department, the department I was hired to work for.
- One interesting event was how the Codefi team (Frenchmen buddies with Nicolas) hacked my laptop to make it look like my sites were failing, and then called a meeting with me where they were going to be very oppressive about this "error" which was a UI hack (they made sure to set up the hack on their own machines so they could "show me" and "shame me").
- The hack disappeared a day or two later after I spoke to a few people about it.
- I was flabbergasted; it was absolutely ridiculous.
- This, I now see, was the second time I experienced my hacked laptop's browser UIs.
- They had somehow got in and interfered with the CSS on my browser.
- [The first time I saw this hack was at Qredo](march.md#qredo) where they published my whitepaper on their website, but it was only live on my machine, the rest of the world saw something completely different.
- I was using the company laptop at the time.
- This is exactly how the porn-gangs of Dénia terrorized me for years, and somewhat still do except I don't care anymore, at all.

### Continued bullying

- So it went on like this.
- Somehow, everyone seemed to know about my online terfing activities - which they absolutely shouldn't - and it feels like I'm being bullied on the basis that I have unwelcome opinions about drag queens in schools, etc...
- I spoke not at all about these things to anyone!
- Madeline scheduled a bi-weekly chat where she was keeping tabs on me. We did not work.
- I had created an excellent presentation about technical docs strategy and showed her at one of these meetings.
- She stole it from me and gave the presentation herself! 
- Then she and Byron told me she had done so!
- I find myself in an impossible situation, right from the start, which I responded to in a rational and self-assertive way.
- I'm then bullied by the wider team, ostensibly for my response to the tantruming Frenchman.
- I'm then ignored completely by all the teams I'm working for - I take a side role contract with another firm for about four months so that I don't go mad with boredom.
- There is also the fact that [I had to whistle-blow about Qredo](march.md#qredo) who were working very closely with one of the Codefi teams I worked with; what else could I do?
- I don't understand how people can know so much evil is going on and just ignore it. For me, not doing anything about it actually causes me visceral pain!
 - The men that are bullying me stop giving me work, and whenever they do give me some they take the opportunity to have another go, tantrum-styley.
- My *bad* name spreads out; probably that I'm a *difficult transphobe, a Karen* or something similar.
- I do get more work with other parts of the business, specifically Infura, which is really great and I enjoy but, again, I feel I am not particularly welcome although it's much much better than core ConsenSys teams.
- Curiously, (I think) I see a man I'm working closely with in ConsenSys Infura out walking in the Pyrenees (August 2022)... I know he's from nearby in France so I'm not totally surprised. We don't speak. 
- I'm now *a bit more* surprised about that. I'd remember his name if I heard it.

### Manipulated romantic attraction to the CEO 

- I move to Dénia during the time I'm working for ConsenSys.
- What I want to highlight today is that, while I was working for them and living at Carrer Furs, even before this, I was being manipulated online with *strong* romantic ideas about Joseph Lubin, the CEO, and very specifically an offsite that he was planning for the whole business!
- I can pinpoint exactly when this manipulation started; it was while I was staying at the Port Dénia hotel in December 2021 waiting to move into my new apartment at Carrer Furs and working online in the hotel.
- The offsite never took place, for some reason, thank God.
- Once cancelled, the romantic ideas I was having about Lubin stopped - they were fundamentally connected to this offsite and the thought I'd meet him in person.
- So weird and sinister.
- I wonder if that was when the (criminal-porn-subscriber) bullying started to ramp up, so they could get me to leave and go somewhere else so I could attend a different offsite.
- Interesting, isn't it.

## Going no-contact

- Something loving suggested I go no-contact with my family in October 2021 and I did so. 
- It felt amazing, liberating.
- I realized I was getting boils with even just the thought of my parents phoning me.
- Going no contact made me feel I could breathe again; like I didn't have to compensate for other people's lack of empathy (at best) towards victims of sexual violence anymore.
- I was no contact with my family from then until April 2024, nearly 3 years.
- It was only when teachers and staff at the conservatory of Dénia made me fear for my life, in March 2024, that I contacted them again, in two hand-written letters (so the hackers would not see them) that explained I had been targeted by Domingo the piano teacher and his associates and family, and I was afraid they were going to murder me.
- My family and I were in contact shortly after that over the phone.

!!! tip "Isolating victims of gender violence"
    - Gender violence involves isolating targets from any possible support networks.
    - In my case, I was already fully isolated when I arrived in Dénia, an abuser's dream.
    - I never once felt isolated or alone, however.
    - The criminals will be very aware that I have a strong spiritual practice. However, they must be atheists, or perhaps they believe God hates women as much as they do, especially abused ones; a foolish stance for a believer.
