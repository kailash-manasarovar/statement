## ConsenSys

- I get an amazing online role with ConsenSys and I work for them from October 2021 to October 2022 but, again, I'm immediately surrounded by a lot of men, and some women, who appear to loathe me.

### Set up, for sport, again

- I'm hired as the lead technical writer for department A (Codefi) where I will build and manage their numerous documentation sites (some of which they already have but mostly will be new).
- Initially, I will be a team of one person only.
- As part of my work, I'll collaborate with department B (Madeline's department) who already run multiple documentation sites.
- I will use the same docs platform they use.
- Madeline's department has been running documentation systems for years. They're extremely efficient and all their systems are working well.
- I don't meet Madeline until week two.
- I meet Byron, the team lead, and Nicolas the docs engineer early on, week one.
- It becomes clear to me very quickly that Nicolas and Byron expect me to work for them too; as an underling team member. 
- I find it extremely strange. They have a lead already. Why would I be OK about working two jobs, one of which I was not hired for?
- One of the first things Byron mentions is how we'll be having an offsite soon.
- I'm a little surprised at this as it is still mostly covid lock-down in the world and he and Madeline are based in Australia.
- Byron seems exited about his department's offsite and mentions it multiple times.
- Again, I'm unclear why I would be invited to another department's offsite.
- To add context, there are numerous technical writers all over the business; why invite just me from outside the department?
- It's all very strange and inexplicable and no-one is clear about any of it; as in what's expected from me with regards to this external team.
- My manager does not add any clarity when I talk to him about it.
- It feels like they're trying to poach me - that's my explanation for it anyway.
- I wonder today if the whole thing was intentional; an impossible situation which can only result in conflict?

### Nicolas 

- Nicolas reaches out and is clearly of the mind that I will be coming to his department to work for them, for him.
- He schedules meetings that last an hour and talks for two hours and I do not get to speak.
- Nicolas tells me he is a light-aircraft pilot in Brittany Northern France; I assume hobbyist.
- He is building a new system for the docs. It's not clear why. They don't need one. Everything's working well.
- Not only that, he is customizing what they have already - an efficient, flexible, and extremely functional platform running millions of websites worldwide - into something inflexible, liable to break, and a single-point-of-failure potentially.
- He expects me to use this new system for *all* my work with my department.
- But the system is unworkable and full of problems; it errors immediately.
- I ask him why he's building something new when he already has a brilliant backend set up? He doesn't have a good answer to this question.
- I explain I'm going to use the platform as normal, without his customizations, until such time as he has fixed the issues and when what he has is better than what we have already.
- He has told me repeatedly he's dedicated to open-source technologies and I suggest he reach out to the community for advice.
- He tantrums.
- I try to reason with him calmly on Slack.
- I tell him I trust him, and I'll let him figure it out, and then we can reconvene, and of course I'll help him with his issues if he needs it.
- He says: *You shouldn't trust anyone!*.
- I'm surprised, but he is tantruming...
- He's actually lost his mind and behaving like an irrational person.
- Remember: this is week two of my role.
- Reluctantly, I talk to my manager about it.
- My manager does not clear up my confusion around a completely external team expecting me to go work for them as well as the job I was hired for.
- I screenshot some of Nicolas' tantrum including where Nicolas told me I shouldn't trust anyone.
- My manager says: *he shouldn't have said that*.

#### Single-point-of-failure

- Nicolas takes enormous exception to me having used this expression.
- Gabriel Silva from Polygon will describe me as a single-point-of-failure in 2024 to developers while I'm being drugged, poisoned, sedated, raped, and live-streamed onto porn-networks by the porn-gangs of Dénia.
- Interesting, isn't it.
- Is almost as if I've had my own personal criminal porn-series running on the networks for years.

### Mediation

- I ask for mediation.
- This is when I first meet Madeline; his boss.
- My manager (can't remember his name yet), Madeline, Nicolas and I meet for mediation on Zoom.
- Nicolas talks. I do not talk.
- Before we begin, he tells us a lot about his wife's depression and how she had to quit her job.
- Nicolas then suggests I'm a disrespectful and rude person, and says a bunch of slightly-offensive things about me personally which are irrelevant to the work.
- It's hard for me to say anything. 
- I'm new, and I'm under attack, and no-one is standing up for me.
- I write a report about Nicolas' system and how it is unworkable at the current time (my view is it completely unnecessary and will never be workable).
- I wonder if he's trying to build something that only he can use so as to ensure his role somehow.
- I don't have a rational explanation for any of this until the time of writing, January 2026.

#### Ugly underlying intentions

- I'm just wondering now if the true intention was to get me to use something that was going to break all the time, and to make sure I was the one to blame for it so I could be in a continued state of stress.
- Was this the *give her a reason for being stressed and anxious* needed to explain any depression and anxiety after sedated off-sites events?
- Was Nicolas apoplectic because I (kind-of) saw the trap before they were able to set it properly?

### The Codefi team and their UI hack

- From here, I'm bullied full-on by nearly everyone I work with; although I do meet and interact with some amazing people at ConsenSys, they're sadly not people I work with.
- I carry on with what I'm doing and build some really cool and efficient sites for the Codefi department, the department I was hired to work for.
- One interesting event was how the Codefi team (Frenchmen buddies in support of their mate Nicolas) hacked into my company laptop to make it look like my sites were failing, and then called a meeting to show me this dreadful "error" which was a UI hack (they made sure to set up the hack on their own machines so they could shame me).
- I was appalled at their juvenile behavior which was really obvious and ridiculous.
- The hack was only apparent on my ConsenSys laptop and disappeared quickly, and after I spoke to a few people about it.
- This, I now see, was the second time I experienced a hacked laptop's browser UI rewrites.
- They had somehow got in and interfered with the CSS on my browser.
- [The first time I saw this hack was at Qredo](march.md#qredo) where they published my whitepaper on their website, but it was only live on my machine, the rest of the world saw something completely different.
- This is exactly how the porn-gangs of Dénia terrorized me for years, and somewhat still do except I don't care anymore, at all.
- I'm guessing millions-upon-millions of women and children's browser UIs are hacked just like this by sexual predators today.

### Continued bullying

- So it went on like this.
- Somehow, everyone seemed to know about my online terfing activities - which they absolutely shouldn't - and it feels like I'm being bullied on the basis that I have unwelcome opinions about drag queens in schools, etc...
- I spoke not at all about these things to anyone at work!
- Madeline scheduled a bi-weekly chat where she was keeping tabs on me. We did no work, just nattered.
- I had created an excellent presentation about technical docs strategy and showed her at one of these meetings.
- She stole it from me and gave the presentation herself! 
- Then she and Byron told me she had done so!
- I feel really really unlucky.
- I found myself in an impossible situation, right from the start, which I responded to in a rational and self-assertive way.
- I'm then bullied by the wider team, ostensibly for my response to the tantruming Frenchman.
- I'm then ignored completely by all the teams I'm working for - I take a side role contract with another firm for about four months so that I don't go mad with boredom.
- There is also the fact that [I had to whistle-blow about Qredo](march.md#qredo) who were working very closely with one of the Codefi teams I worked with; what else could I do?
- I don't understand how people can know so much evil is going on and just ignore it. For me, not doing anything about it, however small, actually causes me visceral pain!
 - The men that are bullying me stop giving me work, and whenever they do give me some they take the opportunity to have another go, tantrum-styley.
- My *bad* name spreads out; probably that I'm a *difficult transphobe, a Karen* or something similar.
- I do get more work with other parts of the business, specifically Infura, which is really great and I enjoy but, again, I feel I am not particularly welcome although it's much much better than core ConsenSys teams.
- Curiously, (I think) I see a man I'm working closely with in ConsenSys Infura out walking in the Pyrenees (August 2022)... I know he's from nearby in France so I'm not totally surprised. We don't speak. 
- I'm now *a bit more* surprised about that. I'd remember his name if I heard it.

### Manipulated romantic attraction to the CEO 

- I move to Dénia just a few months after I start my new job at ConsenSys.
- What I want to highlight today is that, while I was working for them and living at Carrer Furs, even before this, I was being manipulated online with *strong* romantic ideas about Joseph Lubin, the CEO, and very specifically an offsite that he was planning for the whole business!
- I can pinpoint exactly when this manipulation started; it was while I was staying at the Port Dénia hotel in December 2021, waiting to move into my new apartment at Carrer Furs, and I was working online in the hotel.
- The offsite never took place, for some reason, thank God.
- It was not rescheduled either; the idea of a company offsite happening just sort of disintegrated and no-one spoke about it anymore.
- Once cancelled, probably around April 2022 at the same time I was signing up for [the conservatory switcheroo porn](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#four-distinct-men), the romantic ideas I was having about Lubin stopped - they were fundamentally connected to the offsite and the thought I'd meet him in person.
- So weird and sinister.
- I wonder if that was when the (criminal-porn-subscriber) bullying started to ramp up, so they could get me to leave and go somewhere else so I could attend a different offsite.

## Going no-contact

- Something loving suggested I go no-contact with my family in October 2021 and I did so. 
- It felt amazing, liberating.
- I realized I was getting boils with even just the thought of my parents phoning me.
- Going no contact made me feel I could breathe again; like I didn't have to compensate for other people's lack of empathy (at best) towards victims of sexual violence anymore.
- I was no contact with my family from then until April 2024, nearly 3 years.
- It was only when teachers and staff at the conservatory of Dénia made me fear for my life, in March 2024, that I contacted them again, in two hand-written letters (so the hackers would not see them) that explained I had been targeted by Domingo the piano teacher and his associates and family, and I was afraid they were going to murder me.
- My family and I were in contact shortly after that over the phone.

!!! tip "Isolating victims of gender violence"
    - Gender violence involves isolating targets from any possible support networks.
    - In my case, I was already fully isolated when I arrived in Dénia, an abuser's dream.
    - I never once felt isolated or alone, however.
    - The criminals will be very aware that I have a strong spiritual practice. However, they must be atheists, or perhaps they believe God hates women as much as they do, especially abused ones; a foolish stance for a believer.
