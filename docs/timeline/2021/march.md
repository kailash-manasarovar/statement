- I stay in Lourdes, France for the whole of 2021, in the hope I may heal my broken heart. 

![Bernadette](../../content/images/bernadette.jpg)

- I rent a small studio flat at the [Zenitude Acacia](https://www.zenitude-hotel-residences.com/fr_FR/residence/lourdes/121), 1 A Chemin de Lannedarré, 65100 Lourdes.
- I move in at the beginning of January.

## The Portuguese man next door 

- From time to time, a man visits and he stays in the apartment next to mine - or he has access to it because I see him coming and going from there.
- Sometimes, when I'm coming out of my apartment, he comes out of the one beside mine at exactly the same time, and he always looks at me.
- He makes sure I see his face. He needs me to [recognize him in the future](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#the-younger-brother-of-the-first-man).
- The reception staff know him to be Portuguese. 
- He looks like the trumpet teacher, except I'm not to meet the trumpet teacher for 18-24 months still.
- Whenever he visited, on usually a Sunday or Monday night, he got together with some of the younger men there and they had loud drinking sessions into the night with loud music.
- The staff at the Acacia will remember him; as will the male residents who drank with him, some of whom I will know too.
- Was he sent by British criminal gangs to hack into my home network?

!!! tip "Thoughts on this startling realization"
    - Gypsies usually speak multiple languages fluently, and I suspect it would not be hard to convince the French staff he was Portuguese not Spanish, except for identification documents.
    - It appears this man, or the gang he works for, have been tracking and stalking me for years; this being more proof of that.
    - My suspicions are that he came to access my network and online activity at that time, and possibly needed to be close enough physically to do so because I was running a 4g router that pinged off a French telecommunications tower.
    - I'm also now wondering if he managed to gain access to my room too.
    - I'm curious about an unwell feeling I had the day I left for holiday in Spain, and the invasive bed bug problem, a situation which prompted me to change all my plans for Christmas and go to Dénia instead, where I found and rented the flat in Carrer Furs ... and the rest is history in the making.

## Qredo

- wip
- I start a contract role as a technical writer for crypto company Qredo.
- Anita Diamond is also working as a technical write for the company.
- This is a huge coincidence - or is it?
- I'm very surprised to see Anita, an old and dear friend who has suffered from mental health issues ever since she was a teenager.
- I remember [her being rather unpleasant with me previously](../early-years/2006.md#matthew-and-anita-say-something-i-only-mentioned-online) so I'm not delighted to see her. It is very weird though.
- Anyway, we do reconnect, and I'm friendly and happy to see her.
- However, she keeps mentioning things related to me being targeted by the North London rape gangs, and, as she says these things - *oh you loved the rave scene didn't you*, etc, I believe she is doing it to upset me.
- I file it away.
- It's curious how obsessed the criminal gangs were about my experience in 1989, and how they tried to make me remember it, again and again.
- Did Matthew tell her to say these things?
- A staggering overplay by the global male porn-addict tech elite? 
- Or an investigatory gauge on how much dedicated effort and how many porn addicts were expected to sign up and pay expensive subscriptions for the [*switcheroo* sedated rape-porn planned for me on my inevitable return to Dénia](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#four-distinct-men).
- Or both?
