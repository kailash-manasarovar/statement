- I stay in Lourdes, France for the whole of 2021, in the hope I may heal my broken heart. 

![Bernadette](../../content/images/bernadette.jpg)

- I rent a small studio flat at the [Zenitude Acacia](https://www.zenitude-hotel-residences.com/fr_FR/residence/lourdes/121), 1 A Chemin de Lannedarré, 65100 Lourdes.
- I move in at the beginning of January.

## The Portuguese man next door 

- From time to time, a man visits and he stays in the apartment next to mine - or he has access to it because I see him coming and going from there.
- Sometimes, when I'm coming out of my apartment, he comes out of the one beside mine at exactly the same time, and he always looks at me.
- He makes sure I see his face. He needs me to [recognize him in the future](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#the-younger-brother-of-the-first-man).
- The reception staff know him to be Portuguese. 
- He looks like the trumpet teacher, except I'm not to meet the trumpet teacher for 18-24 months still.
- Whenever he visited, on usually a Sunday or Monday night, he got together with some of the younger men there and they had loud drinking sessions into the night with loud music.
- The staff at the Acacia will remember him; as will the male residents who drank with him, some of whom I will know too.
- Was he sent by British criminal gangs to hack into my home network?

!!! tip "Thoughts on this startling realization"
    - Gypsies usually speak multiple languages fluently, and I suspect it would not be hard to convince the French staff he was Portuguese not Spanish, except for identification documents.
    - It appears this man, or the gang he works for, have been tracking and stalking me for years; this being more proof of that.
    - My suspicions are that he came to access my network and online activity at that time, and possibly needed to be close enough physically to do so because I was running a 4g router that pinged off a French telecommunications tower.
    - I'm also now wondering if he managed to gain access to my room too.
    - I'm curious about an unwell feeling I had the day I left for holiday in Spain, and the invasive bed bug problem, a situation which prompted me to change all my plans for Christmas and go to Dénia instead, where I found and rented the flat in Carrer Furs ... and the rest is history in the making.

## Qredo

- Soon after the [Chronicle Software](january.md#chronicle-software) role goes sour, I'm offered a new contract with a crypto company [Qredo](https://www.qredo.com/).
- On the first day, I see a name fly by on Slack: *Anita Diamond*.
- You may remember [Anita and her husband visiting me in Dénia in 2006](../early-years/2006.md#matthew-and-anita-say-something-i-only-mentioned-online), just before the [Dave Porter Guardian Soulmates porn-fatwa fiasco](../early-years/2006.md#guardian-soulmates), orchestrated online by Hazel Smith and her manipulation-tech associates.
- Anita Diamond, it turns out, is also working as a technical writer for the company, the role I've just been hired for.
- This is a huge coincidence - or is it?
- I'm very surprised to see Anita, an old and dear friend who has suffered from serious mental health issues ever since she was a teenager.
- Like all the porn-gang-tailored relationships, something happens when they're done with you that ensures you don't maintain communication.
- Anita and Matthew had been [rather unpleasant with me](../early-years/2006.md#matthew-and-anita-say-something-i-only-mentioned-online) after they visited, so I'm not entirely thrilled to see her and wonder how things are going to be with her.
- Of course, we reconnect, and I'm friendly and happy to see her.
- I am delighted to see her, in fact, and remember only the good things I always loved about her.
- Nevertheless, something is off.
- She keeps mentioning things related to me being targeted by the North London rape gangs back in 1989, and, as she says these things - *oh you loved the rave scene didn't you*, etc, I'm certain she is doing it to upset me.
- I file it away.
- Did Matthew tell her to say these things?
- Anyway, Qredo was a scam company.
- They had a backend system which was supposed to run millions of crypto transactions safely and securely, but in truth it was eight [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.com/), that kept failing, networked up together.
- Raspberry Pis are how schoolkids learn about computing.
- I'm scratching my chin now, just like [Harsha did in 2018](../early-years/interim.md#hired-for-sport-again).
- I'm tasked with writing their Whitepaper.
- I produce a detailed and honest description of everything they have, without saying *it's never gonna work*.
- They hire another writer who works with the CTO (*he's the man* Anita told me, in a kind of breathless reverence), who had been out of the company for a short period while he was in rehab - I was told. 
- I wondered if they meant prison.
- Anyway, in the first obvious evidence that my entire UI has been hacked (I'm on a company laptop), they publish my Whitepaper on their website, the honest one, but I can only see it from my laptop.
- When I look the company up from a different device on a completely different network I see something very different.
- They publish total lies about the tech; that it's robust, fast, secure, that it can cope with heavy load.
- I'm flabbergasted.
- In the meantime, Anita has been set up to fall out with me, which we do, spectacularly.
- Mediation is called and she's fired.
- I'm [back from my holiday in Dénia](july.md#denia-holiday), and I start feeling very anxious, all the time.
- I wonder about this now.
- I start looking for another role because I cannot continue with Qredo given they're total liars and I expect they're about to run a crypto token sale where millions of crypto traders will buy tokens in this system which is set to fail.
- And of course, that happens.
- I get a new job at [ConsenSys](https://consensys.io/) and leave Qredo.
- I'm so appalled at Qredo, I report them to a SEC lawyer who tells me they're not interested in taking it any further - small fry, I guess.
- Horrifyingly, when I join ConsenSys, I find out that a team I'm working with is working closely with Qredo.
- I've no option but to tell them the truth, and that probably sets my time up at ConsenSys which was yet more ridiculousness from male engineers.
- Was the Qredo role with Anita Diamond a staggering overplay by the global male porn-addict tech elite? 
- Or an investigatory gauge on how much dedicated effort and how many porn addicts were expected to sign up and pay expensive subscriptions for the [*switcheroo* sedated rape-porn planned for me on my inevitable and already being prepared return to Dénia](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#four-distinct-men).
- Or both?
