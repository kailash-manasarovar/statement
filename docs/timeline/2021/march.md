## Qredo

- wip
- Anita Diamond was there.
- A staggering overplay by the global male porn-addict tech elite?
- I'm very surprised to see Anita, an old and dear friend who has suffered from mental health issues ever since she was a teenager.
- I remember her being rather unpleasant with me previously so I'm not delighted to see her. It is very weird though.
- Anyway, we do reconnect, and I'm friendly and happy to see her.
- However, she keeps mentioning things related to me being targeted by the North London rape gangs, and, as she says these things - *oh you loved the rave scene didn't you*, etc, I believe she is doing it to upset me.
- I file it away.
- It's curious how obsessed the criminal gangs were about my experience in 1989, and how they tried to make me remember it, again and again.
- Did Matthew tell her to say these things?
