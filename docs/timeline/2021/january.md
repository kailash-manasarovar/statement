## Chronicle Software

- I get a lovely lucrative contract with a company [Chronicle Software](https://chronicle.software/).
- It's Java-based, and I'm delighted to be working in the code again.
- I'm hired to rewrite their tutorials which are out of date and full of bugs.
- I do a really good job, as usual, and they cannot deny it.
- Four weeks after starting, I'm told that my day rate is too high and they are not going to honor it.
- They want to give me a pay cut of more than 30%.
- Of course I leave.
- It's outrageous and I do not understand it.
- I got on with everyone, it was a lovely job.
- Again, something else is going on.
- Chronicle Software is a company in the same high-frequency trading space that [Adaptive](../early-years/interim.md#hired-for-sport-again) and many crypto firms I worked with belong in.
- Java programming is a small world, getting smaller.
- In 2025, I think they had heard about my growing infamy, on the grapevine, and were literally just curious about me.
- They hired me for a bit, satisfied their curiosity, and got rid of me.
- Well you wouldn't want me hanging around if you knew murderous gitano porn-gangs had me in their sights, would you.

!!! tip "An alternative motive"
    - Given what was coming up for me had been [in planning for decades](../2001-to-2010/2003.md#porn-fatwa), and given the very lucrative tech-bro porn-addict market which I was centred in professionally, there is another potential motive for this ridiculous contract.
    - Perhaps Chronicle were tasked with assessing my tech skills and understanding, to check if I would notice the most obvious scam at [Qredo](march.md#qredo).
    - Their close contacts in the industry, such as Adaptive, never bothered to give me any actual work, or talk to or treat me like a human being, so they would have assumed I was an idiot.
    - Did Chronicle spend three weeks assessing whether or not I really was an idiot, and report back that I was, just like every female-tech-colleague?
    - Does the tech-bro-porn-addict's hatred blind him to the truth? 
    - Hatred blinds completely.
    - Has the tech-bro hatred of women broken all boundaries to justify the most outrageous evil towards innocent people, and no-one that can do anything about it cares?

## A dream

- I had an interesting dream shortly after my aunt Mairead died.
- A cherub - that reminded me of something in Dénia, and I even went looking for it when I moved back - flew in through the door and picked me up in its arms and we flew over to the rock at Massabielle and went inside.
- There were cherubs sitting in a circle and I was brought into the circle and I sat very closely to the cherub who had picked me up, who reminded me of a girl I went to school with, Fiona.
- But the cherub's face wasn't like Fiona's at all, but for some reason it reminded me of her.
- And then the boss came, Archangel Michael, and he was like an enormous ... I don't have words really ... and I was so scared I started crying and the cherub comforted me.
- On Deso, I said it had felt like a job interview, and it had somehow.

- From that moment, I knew Archangel Michael as the boss.
- I even told Sandra Diaz about this dream, and I now go to the rock to pay respect as much as possible whenever I am in Lourdes.
- I had thought that there were paintings of cherubs just like the one who whisked me off in one of the churches in Dénia, and in 2022 I went to look for them, but there weren't any.
- When I did [the detox in Glastonbury in 2022](../2022/july.md#glastonbury), the female host was called Fiona, and I thought maybe the dream was something to do with her, but that really didn't make any sense.
- You know, I wonder, could Hazel Smith's real name be Fiona?
