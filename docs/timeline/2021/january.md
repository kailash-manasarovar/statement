## Chronicle Software

- I get a lovely lucrative contract with a company [Chronicle Software](https://chronicle.software/).
- It's Java-based, and I'm delighted to be working in the code again.
- I'm hired to rewrite their tutorials which are out of date and full of bugs.
- I do a really good job, as usual, and they cannot deny it.
- Four weeks after starting, I'm told that my day rate is too high and they are not going to honor it.
- They want to give me a pay cut of more than 30%.
- Of course I leave.
- It's outrageous and I do not understand it.
- I got on with everyone, it was a lovely job.
- Again, something else is going on.
- Chronicle Software is a company in the high-frequency trading space that [Adaptive](../early-years/interim.md#hired-for-sport-again) and many crypto firms I worked with belong in.
- Java programming is a small world, getting smaller.
- In 2025, I think they had heard about my growing infamy, on the grapevine, and were literally just curious about me.
- They hired me for a bit, satisfied their curiosity, and got rid of me.
- Well you wouldn't want me hanging around if you knew murderous gitano porn-gangs had me in their sights, would you.
