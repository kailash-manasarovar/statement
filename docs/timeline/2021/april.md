## Something weird happening when I sleep

- In Lourdes, at the Acacia, where anyone can enter my room at any time due to lock health-and-safety rules, and [one of the trumpet teachers](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#the-younger-brother-of-the-first-man) is turning up regularly and [accessing the room next to mine](march.md#the-portuguese-man-next-door), I start to have a strange experience.
- I'm sleeping and I start to shout in my sleep.
- I wake myself up from it.
- Everything is completely quiet.
- This happens frequently.
- I find it so strange I start to record my sleeps for noise.
- There is never anything untoward on the recordings.
- I tell [Anita at Qredo](march.md#qredo) about this.
