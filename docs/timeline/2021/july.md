## The Portugese man next door at Lourdes

- I'm living in a small studio flat at the [Zenitude Acacia](https://www.zenitude-hotel-residences.com/fr_FR/residence/lourdes/121), 1 A Chemin de Lannedarré, 65100 Lourdes in Lourdes, France.
- I moved here at the beginning of January 2021.
- From time to time, a man visits and he stays in the room next to me - or he has access to the room next to mine because I see him coming and going from there.
- The reception staff know him to be Portuguese. 
- He looks like the trumpet teacher, except I'm not to meet the trumpet teacher for 18-24 months still.

!!! danger "This man is the trumpet teacher"
    - I now believe this man to be the trumpet teacher.

- This man visits from time to time, temporarily. I remember him maybe coming 3 or 4 times while I was there. He always stayed next door, or I saw him coming and going from the next door flat.
- Whenever he stayed, he got together with some of the younger men there and they had loud drinking sessions into the night with loud music.
- The staff at the Acacia will remember him; as will the male residents who drank with him, some of whom I will know too.

!!! tip "Thoughts on this startling realization"
    - Gypsies usually speak multiple languages, and I suspect it would not be hard to convince the French staff he was Portuguese not Spanish, except for identification documents.
    - This man will have been tracking and stalking me for years and this is more proof of that.

## Dénia holiday

- I go to Dénia for my summer holiday. I wonder now if that was "suggested" online to me.
- The day I leave I feel extremely unwell in a weird way, not sick exactly but nothing is working properly. Thinking back, it is rather like the poisoned feeling I have been having in Denia over the last 3 years.
- When in Denia, I meet Christine for lunch a couple of times. She's an old friend I used to walk with, and talk about my PhD with, years before. She tells me her views on trans ideology and I quietly agree.
- I share with her that I am a child sexual abuse survivor of a grooming gang. I also tell her that I probably would be trans and removing my breasts, womb, and ovaries had I been born 30 years later.
- I tell Christine I have been suffering from a debilitating depression after reporting child sexual abuse to the Met Police in 2016.

!!! info
    - The main reason I'm elaborating so much on my state of mind prior to rejoining the conservatory in September 2022 is to give a backdrop as to why I may not have been in a good position to ascertain immediately that I was being medicated/drugged without my knowledge or consent.

### Lorraine Blackbourn 

- Lorraine Blackbourn killed herself the week I visited and her funeral was on or around the day I arrived. 

!!! danger "Astonishing timing"
    - I now believe Lorraine was targeted online like I was using NLP and sentiment manipulation.
    - I believe she was driven to suicide.
    - I don't know why she would have been targeted, but the timing of it is really interesting given my experiences. 
    - Is there something even more sinister going on in Denia than just the regular porn gang epidemic activity?
    - I also wonder now if she was being drugged/poisoned.

- Lorraine was a British woman I used to work for in Dénia. She ran the English Studio academy there. 
- I had previously disconnected from everyone I knew because I was so suicidal. It didn't seem fair to keep people close. I was also finding it extremely difficult to relate to people because of my experiences.
- For these reasons, I wasn't in touch with anyone in Denia and I didn't know Lorraine had died by suicide until nearly a year later when I bumped into someone who told me. I had assumed Lorraine's death was due to illness.

!!! warning "Concerns about Lorraine's untimely death"
    - I'm concerned now that Lorraine's may have been driven to suicide, in the same way gang stalkers clearly wanted my life to end.
    - Fake and stalker accounts on Twitter often mentioned Lorraine in relation to stalking and "whistle-blowing", a reference I didn't understand, and still don't. Maybe law enforcement will understand what this means better.
    - The account below had been following me for some time around March 2024 when I finally left my studies at the conservatory due to being afraid for my life.
    - This account ran gang-stalking harassment interactions with me, with the help of some of the other accounts. I found the name and content choices interesting.

    - The account is now deleted.

### Thinking about moving back

- While I'm there, I remember how lovely Dénia is, and how much I loved living there, and I start to harbour a strong desire to move back.
- I search for a flat repeatedly online but there is nothing available at all.
- I realize AirBNB type accommodation has taken over the rental market in this part of the world.

## Joining Twitter

- I join Twitter with my current account [@1frgvn](https://x.com/1FRGVN) in August.
- I am anonymous and I use my account to support activists against the abuses to children and Women's rights arising from trans ideology. 
- I also use Twitter extensively as therapy and post often about my child sexual abuse experiences and the suicidal depression I have been suffering since 2015.
