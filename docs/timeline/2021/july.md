- I stay in Lourdes, France for the whole of 2021, in the hope I may heal my broken heart. 

![Bernadette](../../content/images/bernadette.jpg)

- I rent a small studio flat at the [Zenitude Acacia](https://www.zenitude-hotel-residences.com/fr_FR/residence/lourdes/121), 1 A Chemin de Lannedarré, 65100 Lourdes.
- I move in at the beginning of January.

## The Portuguese man next door 

- From time to time, a man visits and he stays in the apartment next to mine - or he has access to it because I see him coming and going from there.
- Sometimes, when I'm coming out of my apartment, he comes out of the one beside mine at exactly the same time, and he always looks at me.
- The reception staff know him to be Portuguese. 
- He looks like the trumpet teacher, except I'm not to meet the trumpet teacher for 18-24 months still.
- Whenever he visited, on usually a Sunday or Monday night, he got together with some of the younger men there and they had loud drinking sessions into the night with loud music.
- The staff at the Acacia will remember him; as will the male residents who drank with him, some of whom I will know too.

!!! tip "Thoughts on this startling realization"
    - Gypsies usually speak multiple languages fluently, and I suspect it would not be hard to convince the French staff he was Portuguese not Spanish, except for identification documents.
    - It appears this man, or the gang he works for, have been tracking and stalking me for years; this being more proof of that.
    - My suspicions are that he was accessing my network at that time and possibly needed to be close enough physically to do so.
    - I'm also now wondering if he managed to gain access to my room too.
    - I'm curious about an unwell feeling I had the day I left for holiday in Spain, and the invasive bed bug problem, a situation which prompted me to change all my plans for Christmas and go to Dénia instead, where I found and rented the flat in Carrer Furs ... and the rest is history in the making.

## Dénia holiday

- I go to Dénia for my summer holiday. I wonder now if that was "suggested" online to me.
- The day I leave I feel extremely unwell in a weird way, not sick exactly but nothing is working properly. I feel heavy, tired, and unwell. My eyesight is straining and I feel a little nauseous. Thinking back, it is rather like the poisoned feeling I often had in Dénia in my apartment.
- During my trip, I meet Christine for lunch a couple of times. She tells me her views on trans ideology and I quietly agree. 
- I share with her that I am a child sexual abuse survivor of a grooming gang. I also tell her that I probably would be trans and removing my breasts, womb, and ovaries had I been born 30 years later.
- I tell Christine I have been suffering from a debilitating depression after reporting child sexual abuse to the Met Police in 2016.

### Elaine Black 

- [Elaine Black](../early-years/2008.md#working-for-elaine-black) killed herself the week I visited and her funeral was on or around the day I arrived. 
- A few days after that, I was coming back from the Las Marinas beach towards the Daniya hotel where I was staying.
- As I crossed the road in front of the [Katmandu Indian restaurant](https://www.google.com/maps/place/KATHMANDU+RESTAURANT./@38.8473292,0.0998328,17z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x129e1b1eab713bef:0xb942b79aaf5ee018!2sRestaurante+Rani+Palace!8m2!3d38.8463516!4d0.1075146!16s%2Fg%2F11cmfs1pyt!3m5!1s0x129e1b117d23e84d:0x99265dc6a93775f6!8m2!3d38.8489761!4d0.0971108!16s%2Fg%2F12cp73vx8?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), I saw an old friend, Caroline, sitting at a table-for-two on her own, right in front of the entrance.
- She looked devastated.
- I wonder who Caroline was with, and where that person was at the moment I saw her.
- Or was she eating alone?
- It was an odd place to sit if you were crying your eyes out.

!!! danger "Astonishing timing"
    - I now believe Elaine was targeted online like I was, using NLP and sentiment manipulation and possibly drugs and poisons.
    - I believe she was driven to suicide.
    - Is something extremely sinister going on in Dénia?
    - Are criminal gangs simply taking advantage of a small-town gone very wrong?
    - Are we seeing yet another vile effect of rampant porn addictions in men and boys?

- Elaine was a British woman I used to work for in Dénia. She ran the English Studio academy there. 
- I mention her in a [previous chapter](../early-years/2008.md#working-for-elaine-black).
- Due to depression, I had disconnected from everyone I knew. It didn't seem fair to keep people close. I was also finding it extremely difficult to relate to people because of my experiences and the anxiety I was suffering from.
- For these reasons, I wasn't in touch with anyone in Dénia and I didn't know Elaine had died by suicide until nearly a year later when I bumped into someone who told me. At the time, I had assumed Elaine's death was due to illness.

!!! warning "Retrospective concerns about Elaine's untimely death"
    - I'm concerned now that Elaine may have been driven to suicide, in the same way gang stalkers clearly wanted my life to end.
    - Fake and stalker accounts on Twitter often mentioned Elaine in relation to stalking and "whistle-blowing", a reference I didn't understand, and still don't. 
    - Maybe law enforcement will understand what this means better, or maybe they ignored her too.
    - The account below had been following me for some time around March 2024 when I finally left my studies at the conservatory due to being made afraid for my life.
    - This account ran gang-stalking harassment interactions with me, with the help of some of the other accounts. I found the name and content choices interesting.

    - The account is now deleted.

### Thinking about moving back

- While I'm there, I remember how lovely Dénia is, and how much I loved living there, and I start to harbour a strong desire to move back.
- I search for a flat repeatedly online but there is nothing available.
- I realize AirBNB type accommodation has taken over the rental market in this part of the world.

## Joining Twitter

- I join Twitter with my account [@1frgvn](https://x.com/1FRGVN) in August.
- I am anonymous and I use my account to support activists against the abuses to children and women's rights arising from trans ideology. 
- I also use Twitter extensively as therapy and post often about my child sexual abuse experiences and the suicidal depression I have been suffering since 2015.
- Anyone stalking or surveilling me at that time will have had a deep insight into my state of mind and could only assume that a three-year campaign of terror against me would likely drive me to suicide.
- As well as my state of mind, I mention old experiences which will be used later on to intimidate and terrorize me while I'm being stalked online.
