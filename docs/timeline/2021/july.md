## Dénia holiday

- I'm living in France.
- I go to Dénia for my summer holiday.
- I meet Christine Betterton Jones for lunch a couple of times. She's an old friend I used to walk with and talk about my PhD with years before. She tells me her views on trans ideology and I quietly agree with ehr. I share with her that I am a child sexual abuse survivor, grooming gangs, and tell her that I probably would be trans and removing my breasts had I been born 30 years later.
- Lorraine Blackbourn had just killed herself the week I visited and her funeral was on around the day I arrived. Lorraine was a British woman I used to work for in Dénia. She ran the English Studio academy there. 
- I had disconnected from everyone I knew because I was so suicidal. It didn't seem fair to keep people close. I was also finding it extremely difficult to relate to people because of my experiences.
- I assumed Lorraine's death was due to illness.
- While I'm there, I remember how lovely Dénia is and desire to move back.
- I search for a flat repeatedly online but there is nothing available at all.

## Join Twitter in August

- I join Twitter with my current account [@1frgvn](https://x.com/1FRGVN).
- I am anonymous and I use my account to support activists against transing children. 
- I also use Twitter extensively as therapy and post often about my child sexual abuse experiences and the depression I have been suffering since 2015.
