# July 2021

- I am in Lourdes, France for the whole of 2021.
- I rent a small studio flat at the [Zenitude Acacia](https://www.zenitude-hotel-residences.com/fr_FR/residence/lourdes/121), 1 A Chemin de Lannedarré, 65100 Lourdes.
- I moved in at the beginning of January.

## The Portuguese man next door 

- From time to time, a man visits and he stays in the room next to me - or he has access to the room next to mine because I see him coming and going from there, i.e. sometimes when I'm coming out of my room, he comes out of the room beside me at exactly the same and looks at me.
- The reception staff know him to be Portuguese. 
- He looks like the trumpet teacher, except I'm not to meet the trumpet teacher for 18-24 months still.

!!! danger "This man is the trumpet teacher"
    - I now believe this man to be the one of the main 'trumpet teacher' characters.

- This man visits from time to time, temporarily. I remember seeing him 3 or 4 times while I was there. He always stayed next door, or I saw him coming and going from the next door flat.
- Whenever he stayed, usually a Sunday or Monday night, he got together with some of the younger men there and they had loud drinking sessions into the night with loud music.
- The staff at the Acacia will remember him; as will the male residents who drank with him, some of whom I will know too.

!!! tip "Thoughts on this startling realization"
    - Gypsies usually speak multiple languages, and I suspect it would not be hard to convince the French staff he was Portuguese not Spanish, except for identification documents.
    - This man will have been tracking and stalking me for years and this is more proof of that.
    - My suspicions are that he was accessing my network at that time and probably needed to be close to it to do so.
    - I'm also now wondering if he managed to gain access to my room.
    - I'm curious about the invasive bed bug problem I had when I moved rooms which prompted me to go to Dénia and rent the flat there ... and the rest is now history in the making.

## Dénia holiday

- I go to Dénia for my summer holiday. I wonder now if that was "suggested" online to me.
- The day I leave I feel extremely unwell in a weird way, not sick exactly but nothing is working properly. I feel heavy, tired, and unwell. My eyesight is straining and I feel a little nauseous. Thinking back, it is rather like the poisoned feeling I had in Dénia in my apartment there.
- When in Dénia, I meet Christine for lunch a couple of times. She tells me her views on trans ideology and I quietly agree. 
- I share with her that I am a child sexual abuse survivor of a grooming gang. I also tell her that I probably would be trans and removing my breasts, womb, and ovaries had I been born 30 years later.
- I tell Christine I have been suffering from a debilitating depression after reporting child sexual abuse to the Met Police in 2016.

!!! info
    - The main reason I'm elaborating so much on my state of mind prior to rejoining the conservatory in September 2022 is to give a backdrop as to why I may not have been in a good position to ascertain immediately that I was being medicated/drugged without my knowledge or consent.

### Elaine Black 

- [Elaine Black](../early-years/2008.md#working-for-elaine-black) killed herself the week I visited and her funeral was on or around the day I arrived. 

!!! danger "Astonishing timing"
    - I now believe Elaine was targeted online like I was, using NLP and sentiment manipulation and possibly drugs and poisons.
    - I believe she was driven to suicide.
    - I don't know why she would have been targeted, but the timing of it is really interesting given my experiences. 
    - Is something really sinister going on in Dénia?

- Elaine was a British woman I used to work for in Dénia. She ran the English Studio academy there. 
- I had disconnected from everyone I knew because I was feeling suicidal. It didn't seem fair to keep people close. I was also finding it extremely difficult to relate to people because of my experiences and the anxiety I was suffering from.
- For these reasons, I wasn't in touch with anyone in Dénia and I didn't know Elaine had died by suicide until nearly a year later when I bumped into someone who told me. At the time, I had assumed Elaine's death was due to illness.

!!! warning "Concerns about Elaine's untimely death"
    - I'm concerned now that Elaine may have been driven to suicide, in the same way gang stalkers clearly wanted my life to end.
    - Fake and stalker accounts on Twitter often mentioned Elaine in relation to stalking and "whistle-blowing", a reference I didn't understand, and still don't. 
    - Maybe law enforcement will understand what this means better, or maybe they ignored her too.
    - The account below had been following me for some time around March 2024 when I finally left my studies at the conservatory due to being afraid for my life.
    - This account ran gang-stalking harassment interactions with me, with the help of some of the other accounts. I found the name and content choices interesting.

    - The account is now deleted.

### Thinking about moving back

- While I'm there, I remember how lovely Dénia is, and how much I loved living there, and I start to harbour a strong desire to move back.
- I search for a flat repeatedly online but there is nothing available.
- I realize AirBNB type accommodation has taken over the rental market in this part of the world.

## Joining Twitter

- I join Twitter with my current account [@1frgvn](https://x.com/1FRGVN) in August.
- I am anonymous and I use my account to support activists against the abuses to children and Women's rights arising from trans ideology. 
- I also use Twitter extensively as therapy and post often about my child sexual abuse experiences and the suicidal depression I have been suffering since 2015.
- Anyone stalking or surveilling me will have a deep insight into my state of mind.
- Does this lure them into committing outrageous and vile acts against a female target which they believe they will never have to answer to?
- Is this what they 'always do' to unlucky women and girls?
