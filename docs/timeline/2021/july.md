## Denia holiday

- I go to Denia for my summer holiday in July
- I meet Christine Betterton Jones, an old friend, and she tells me about trans 
- Lorraine Blackbourn had just killed herself and her funeral was on around the day I arrived
- I had disconnected from everyone I knew because I was so suicidal, it didn't seem fair to keep people close, I was also finding it extremely difficult to relate to people because of my experiences
- I remember how lovely Denia is and express a desire to move back
- I search for a flat repeatedly throughout this year but there is nothing available at all

## Join Twitter

- I join Twitter with my current account @1frgvn
- I am anonymous and I use my account to support activists against transing children 
- I also use Twitter extensively as therapy and post about feeling suicidally depressed
