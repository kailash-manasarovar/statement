## Communication example

- Here's a good example of how cyber-stalkers communicate with me.
- I will post something in this statement that annoys them, and they will pick one of my posts that can be used as a way to communicate with me (the wording) and have all their fake accounts like it and repost it.
- This happened yesterday with this post:

- I had just updated information on the [four distinct men](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#four-distinct-men) who came to the conservatory under the name Vidal Sastre Sanchez Hornero and posing as a peripatetic trumpet teacher for the Generalitat Valenciana.
- It must have annoyed them.
- This has been happening to me very obviously since [June 12th 2023](../2023/june.md#monday-12th-june-2023).
