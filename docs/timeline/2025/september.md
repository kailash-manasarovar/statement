# September 2025

## Thunderbolt clarity

- Around the middle of this month, I suddenly become clear about the trumpet teacher and that he was not just one man, he was at least four men.

## Current health

### Eyes

- My eyes remain blurry and painful since [July's poison attack](july.md#eyes-and-kidneys-again-and-heart-now-too) and I'm having a lot of headaches.
- I can feel my eye pressure is high.
- I go in for a reading to Vision Express in Tesco's Colney Hatch Lane and indeed my eye pressure is high.
- I'm worried about sudden onset glaucoma after the diagnosis of [PACS from Rutnin last November](../2024/november.md#pre-glaucoma-eye-condition).
- Moorfields has [not got back to me](july.md#moorfields) since I noticed severe deterioration in my left peripheral and asked for help.
- I book an eye test at Colney Hatch on 17th September.
- I explain I'm concerned about glaucoma.
- The optometrists ask me if I have been hit on the head.
- My sight prescription has not changed at all; even the peripheral test is OK.
- I don't understand it and ask to speak to the optometrist in private.
- I tell the optometrist Zoha Hemraj I think I have been poisoned.
- She's shocked but it seems like my situation and narrow angles make more sense to her now.
- She tells me she is going to nudge Moorfields for further investigation and I should expect to hear from them.
- She also advises I tell my GP.
- I'm reluctant but I make an appointment in any case.

### Rutland House Surgery Muswell Hill

- On 18th September I visit my GP.
- I speak to Dr Shirshana Davis.
- I tell her I believe I was poisoned; low level and continuously over years at my apartment, and then twice maliciously with the intent to kill at the [end of October 2024](../2024/october.md#serious-poisoning-with-intent-to-harm-or-kill) and about [a month before in France](july.md#eyes-and-kidneys-again-and-heart-now-too) in July this year.
- I also tell her that all my stuff was toxic when I brought it home from France in February this year as if it had been doused in pesticides or similar and it made me very unwell until I chucked it out or washed it multiple times.
- I write a timeline of symptoms for her as it is so much to explain.

![Timeline 2](../../content/images/health-diagnosis-timeline/timeline-2.jpeg)
![Timeline 3](../../content/images/health-diagnosis-timeline/timeline-3.jpeg)

- The only thing I missed on here was the snapped rib which happened three times and I believe due to weakened bone mass by poisoning.
- I also give her the [PACS diagnosis](../../content/images/health-diagnosis-timeline/PACS-diagnosis.jpeg) and [kidney check result](../../content/images/health-diagnosis-timeline/kidney-check-BKK.jpeg) from BKK.
- She listens and hears me.
- She suggests immediately the mental health team.
- I explain that I have no more PTSD at all and that my suicidal depression is completely healed and I have no depression at all.
- I explain that something happened to me while I was fighting for my life in Denia in 2023 that unleashed an inner strength I never knew I had.
- I tell her about my Transformational Touch work with Steve Terrell and how much it has helped me heal from trauma.
- I also explain that I have asked numerous agencies; police, embassies, etc, for help and I have been ignored by everyone.
- I tell her I do not feel safe in North London due to this.

!!! tip
    - RA symptoms in my hands seem to be completely gone now.

- She tells me to give my notes to the receptionist who will scan them into my file.
- I do that.
- As the receptionist is scanning my notes in, she suddenly remarks, "Oh, that's weird, the scanner's not working!"
- Her tone sounds like the scanner *always* works.
- I'm unsurprised at this development.
- I ask her to please get these notes into my file in any way she can.
- She photocopies them and tells me she'll do it later.
