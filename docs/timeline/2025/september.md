## Four distinct men 

- As my mind clears and my heart heals from decades of abuse at the hands of the Canos, the Smiths, and their associates in Denia, France, and North London, normal memories of what happened to me are returning.
- I realize now that the *trumpet teacher* was made up of four men who came to the conservatory of Denia in this role under the name Vidal Sastre Sanchez Hornero.

### The older, slimmer, greyer man

- He may have been the first of these men I saw at class before a switch took place.
- I never stopped having an extremely good feeling about this man.
- I only have four solid memories of him where I'm not confusing him with someone else:

    - The time we sat together in class and [I believed he was fundamentally on my side and conspiring with me against Domingo](../2023/february.md#plot-awareness). My words on that evening upset him; he understood what I was doing and I know the way I rewrote the nature of the conspiracy felt right to him.
    - The time not long after when I remember waking up in my bed at home and he was [crying in my arms](../2023/march.md#dreaming-of-the-trumpet-teacher).
    - There was another time I saw him in class for a minute or two, and I was delighted to see him again - now I understand it was unexpectedly - and I smiled and he ignored me, looking sad and downwards, and not looking at me as I said goodbye for the evening.
    - Then, when the attraction-trick stopped working so well, I guess, and they decided to [wheel him out again](../2023/december.md#the-trumpet-teacher-has-a-brother) so I could be re-triggered, and I thought it was his twin brother!

- This is the man I was convinced I loved and who loved me back.

- This is an old picture, the man is about 10 years older now. However, this younger picture demonstrates the likeness between him and the [next bloke I mention](#mark-from-english-class-in-2013) who must be related somehow.
- I wonder if the gypsies made sure that one of the men would be someone I was strongly attracted to in order for the trick to work?
- Did they examine our astrological charts or consult a witch?
- It would not surprise me.
- Regardless, the fact is that without these extremely good feelings I had for this man, and still do, and these short moments in time, we probably wouldn't be where we are today which is becoming something rather marvelous in my view.

### Mark from English class in 2013

- Mark was the larger, taller, darker, more lumbering man that looked enough like the [older, slimmer man](#the-older-slimmer-greyer-man) for me to mistake them after what I assume was some sort of [sedated mistaking people training](#sedated-training-for-recognizing-faces).
- He was someone I had [found attractive when I met him in 2013](../early-years/2008.md#working-for-lorraine-blackbourn) in my English class when I worked for Lorraine Blackbourn.
- It's likely this man is related to Lorraine Blackbourn's ex-husband and indeed was of the same size and shape, and facial features.
- He was the man I saw most often at the conservatory, and I was always anxious around him.
- I remember seeing this man numerous times, including but not limited to the following examples:

    - He was the man [Patricia Penny *introduced* me to in Benijembla](../2022/november.md#walking-in-benijembla-with-the-english-ladies) the week before he turned up at class.
    - He was the man that [stalked me at Lourdes](../2021/july.md#the-portuguese-man-next-door).
    - At the first class in [November 2022](../2022/november.md#the-trumpet-teacher) there he was hovering over Ana after timing a meeting at the toilet.
    - He was the man involved in [poisoning me by overdose](../2023/january.md#serious-poisoning-at-chamber-music-class) with the doctor who had a class scheduled before ours, but only came twice.
    - He was the man who brought the music sheets from Gloria and [handed me his phone](../2023/march.md#the-trumpet-teacher-hands-me-his-phone).
    - The man who [was angry at me](../2023/april.md#back-in-chamber-music-class) after I followed the `@jctot19` account.
    - The man who switched with [the other large man](#an-unknown-man-i-may-have-a-picture-of) right at the end of the [May 2023 concert](../2023/may.md#chamber-music-concert).
    - The man who led my *funeral* on [12th June 2023](../2023/june.md#monday-12th-june-2023).

- I don't have a picture of this man but would recognize him immediately.

### An unknown man I may have a picture of

- There was a similarly tall but even larger man that I can remember seeing a few times.
- He was the man who organized and managed the [chamber music concert](../2023/may.md#chamber-music-concert) where Carmen Cano was in the audience (masquerading or not) as Pablo's mum.
- He had a soft pleasant voice and he was the man who left any messages on my phone.
- He was the man I spoke to who [mentioned a double session in a perverted way](../2023/may.md#teb-with-robin) the night before I saw possible evidence of being anally raped.
- He did look like an older version of the young man in the middle of this picture with his arms around two siblings (I assume).

![Vigas](../../content/images/fake-accounts/family/Vigas%20brothers%20and%20sisters.png)

- The younger brother in the pic looks like the man who came out of the tunnel and [blew at me in the face in March 2024](../2024/march.md#wednesday-13th-march) right before I became convinced I was going to be murdered.
- I'm not sure I have any more solid memories of this man at the conservatory.

### Dark thick-curly-haired deep-set man

- There was another man I have a few memories of which I have already documented.
- I don't remember him ever being at the conservatory.
- I remember him [in my bed calling my name](../2023/april.md#dreaming-of-the-trumpet-teacher).
- He was the man I saw in the banged up Peugeot on the 11th June 2023, [the day before my *funeral*](../2023/june.md#sunday-11th-june) and [driving past me at the beach with the doctor in the passenger seat](../2023/june.md#the-trumpet-teacher-and-the-doctor-joan-drive-past-me), and [driving the blue car slowly past me](../2023/october.md#the-trumpet-teacher-drives-past-me-in-his-car).
- He was also reminiscent of [Patricia Penny's husband](../2021/december.md#christmas) and the [man who came out to terrorize me on Halloween](../2023/october.md#halloween) but not exactly the same - those two men could well be the same man.
- I don't have a picture of this man but he will be very well known in Denia.
- Unless, of course, this is him as a young man:

![The deep-set man](../../content/images/fake-accounts/family/Vigas%20as%20a%20young%20man.jpg)

- Although I did think I saw the grown-up version of this person on the beach on [6th October 2024](../2024/october.md#sunday-6th-october) and have a body cam image too.
- Perhaps they're related.

## Sedated training for recognizing faces

- The question is, of course, how did I manage to mistake four separate men for a single person?
- I was living alone and had no social life.
- I was being drugged continually with substances that blurred my vision and made my thoughts extremely unclear.
- I was being sedated and likely sexually assaulted, except … 
- Is it possible that the four of them treated me very nicely, sweetly, intimately but non-sexually, while I was sedated at home, with the intention of sexual abuse happening later on, possibly after my planned department from the conservatory studies in June 2023?
- Could part of the mind training and manipulation (rehearsals, he called it at class) have included staring at me full in the face while I was sedated and my eyes were open, and I was looking straight at them so I would recognize their faces in real life?
- If they had assaulted me I would have found them frightening in real life, and I didn’t, although they gave me a bad feeling that made me anxious and recoil… apart from the first older man who I never stopped having an extremely good feeling about.

## The Truwoman Show or Please Turn My Wife into a Porn Star

- I’m guessing this is a porn genre and many millions of men and porn addicts internationally know about it, particularly in Spain.
- A great deal of police will be subscribing to this sort of thing.
- They will live stream the trick most likely.
- The series probably include live-streamed gang-rape as a grand finale in which the target is not sedated and recognizes all the men that have been *training* her.
- I wouldn't be surprised if this has killed women and girls outright with the shock.
- Women like schrondigner gata (Rocio Vidal) and the sports woman I mentioned will be viable targets requested by paying viewers.
- It must be common knowledge across the world, and that’s fundamentally why all my complaints are ignored.
- The sick perverts have certainly evolved over the years from targeting wealthy women to setting up a kind of Truwoman Show … just another sick way men have found to delight and get boners at the destruction of women.

### Is this why the McCann case continues to falter?

- The sedating MO is exactly like the McCann case.
- Could this be why the case stalled so badly in the beginning, and why they're trying to pin an extremely professional kidnap job onto an obvious opportunist?
- You only have to look up spy cam porn online to see millions of people unaware they’re being filmed and my guess is a lot of this is coming from Spain and Portugal.

### Sedating porn is normal now

- We were all horrified at the Gisele Pelicot case; but perhaps this is considered completely normal behavior by pornographers and billions of porn viewers.
- I guess the paying viewers feel like they've not quite done child or baby rape but at least they're still getting a sexual hit off something equally abhorrent towards women and girls.
- I wonder if the audiences can request their wives or girlfriends, or colleagues, are targeted .. and whether this is what happened to Mrs Lara, and Lorraine found out somehow… and reported… and was ignored... and was targeted online and manipulated into killing herself.
- Was Mike W was manipulated into everything he did too?
- Is this the backdrop to many of my professional experiences?

## My role

- And running through all this evil and vileness is my journey through it.
- I must have been judged just another “silly little girl”, ready for targeting.
- When they found out I was already a child rape victim, with the films to prove it, they must have thought me non-human and from there found it very easy to justify my murder.
- They must have thought me an easy target with no friends or family, completely isolated, and yet something was going on that no one could have imagined and, once the divine trap was set - set in motion decades before - there was no escape, and even as the bear teeth tightened down on the conspiring fools, they still had so little respect for women and girls they didn’t see it coming the second before it hit.
- Miracles.

## Future optimisms 

- The Rape Gang Inquiry has suggested that the police might now re-investigate my original grooming rape gang case from 1989.
- Except, now, they cannot investigate those crimes without casting an eye on the decades long conspiracy against me.
- How exciting!
- Some amazing investigatory team will be winning official awards for their career-case work ensnaring the nastiest, vilest, pedo-porn gang and serial killing international networked community of perverts and homicidal maniacs the world has ever known.
- May it be very very soon.
- And I myself will buy them all a non-toxic pint.
