# September 2025

## Thunderbolt clarity

- Around the middle of this month, I suddenly become clear about who the trumpet teacher was.
- The four men I remember as playing the role of *trumpet teacher* become clear in my mind and I realize I can detail them and may even have some pictures of them.
- It is possible there are many more men involved.
- I detail the [results of my new and sudden clarity](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#four-distinct-men).

## Current health

### Eyes

- My eyes remain blurry and painful since [July's poison attack](july.md#eyes-and-kidneys-again-and-heart-now-too) and I'm having a lot of headaches.
- I can feel my eye pressure is high.
- I go in for a reading to Vision Express in Tesco's Colney Hatch Lane and indeed my eye pressure is high.
- I'm worried about sudden onset glaucoma after the diagnosis of [PACS from Rutnin last November](../2024/november.md#pre-glaucoma-eye-condition).
- Moorfields has [not got back to me](july.md#moorfields) since I noticed severe deterioration in my left peripheral and asked for help.
- I book an eye test at Colney Hatch on 17th September.
- I explain I'm concerned about glaucoma.
- The optometrists ask me if I have been hit on the head.
- My sight prescription has not changed at all; even the peripheral test is OK.
- I don't understand it and ask to speak to the optometrist in private.
- I tell the optometrist Zoha Hemraj I think I have been poisoned.
- She's shocked but it seems like my situation and narrow angles make more sense to her now.
- She tells me she is going to nudge Moorfields for further investigation and I should expect to hear from them.
- She also advises I tell my GP.
- I'm reluctant but I make an appointment in any case.

### Rutland House Surgery Muswell Hill

- On 18th September I visit my GP.
- I speak to Dr Shirshana Davis.
- I tell her I believe I was poisoned; low level and continuously over years at my apartment, and then twice maliciously with the intent to kill at the [end of October 2024](../2024/october.md#serious-poisoning-with-intent-to-harm-or-kill) and about [a month before in France](july.md#eyes-and-kidneys-again-and-heart-now-too) in July this year.
- I also tell her that all my stuff was toxic when I brought it home from France in February this year as if it had been doused in pesticides or similar and it made me very unwell until I chucked it out or washed it multiple times.
- I write a timeline of symptoms for her as it is so much to explain.

![Timeline 2](../../content/images/health-diagnosis-timeline/timeline-2.jpeg)
![Timeline 3](../../content/images/health-diagnosis-timeline/timeline-3.jpeg)

- The only thing I missed on here was the snapped rib which happened three times and I believe due to weakened bone mass by poisoning.
- I also give her the [PACS diagnosis](../../content/images/health-diagnosis-timeline/PACS-diagnosis.jpeg) and [kidney check result](../../content/images/health-diagnosis-timeline/kidney-check-BKK.jpeg) from BKK.
- She listens and hears me.
- She suggests immediately the mental health team.
- I explain that I have no more PTSD at all and that my suicidal depression is completely healed and I have no depression at all.
- I explain that something happened to me while I was fighting for my life in Denia in 2023 that unleashed an inner strength I never knew I had.
- I tell her about my Transformational Touch work with Steve Terrell and how much it has helped me heal from trauma.
- I also explain that I have asked numerous agencies; police, embassies, etc, for help and I have been ignored by everyone.
- I tell her I do not feel safe in North London due to this.

!!! tip
    - RA symptoms in my hands seem to be completely gone now.

- She tells me to give my notes to the receptionist who will scan them into my file.
- I do that.
- As the receptionist is scanning my notes in, she suddenly remarks, "Oh, that's weird, the scanner's not working!"
- Her tone sounds like the scanner *always* works.
- I'm unsurprised at this development.
- I ask her to please get these notes into my file in any way she can.
- She photocopies them and tells me she'll do it later.
    
## Dublin trauma therapy

- I travel to Dublin for trauma therapy: Transforming Touch.
- The day before the course starts, on Wednesday 24th September, a friend and I visit [Whitefriars Church](https://whitefriarstreetchurch.com/) in Dublin city centre.
- My friend tells me he was drawn to visit the day before and was surprised to find relics of St Valentine there.
- I found this information triggering for some reason and vowed to visit myself on the 29th September, my one free day after the course and before I head home.
- It turned out we ended up there on our walk anyway.
- To my surprise, I found that the statue of St Valentine reminded me of the trumpet teacher somehow.
- I thought it was just because the psychological attack had been so intense, I was triggered by the idea of romance, but there was something more.
- The statue looked, to me, like it was real; a real human being.
- At the time, it was so weird I didn't understand it.
- A few days later, on the therapy table, I realized.
- Valentine reminded me of [all the trumpet teachers](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#four-distinct-men) in fact, but [one of them](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#the-older-slimmer-greyer-man) way way more than all the others.
- There is, in fact, a true and uncanny resemblance.
- The statue in Whitefriars Church looks like the trumpet teacher who had [cried in my arms in my bed](../2023/march.md#valentine) in what I had thought was a dream but I am now pretty sure it wasn't a dream.
- On the 29th September, Michaelmas, I visit again and take some photos.

### Healing process

- On the TT table I have been extremely still for the five full years I have been doing the therapy practice. 
- I do not move at all.
- Since March this year, while doing TT shares at Purim-time, my therapy process has changed.
- I started experiencing eye-twitching very slightly, and I assumed this was something from 1989.
- In June, on a TT intensive, this eye-twitching became more pronounced.
- On the course this month, the eye-twitching is now quite extreme. It's as if some physical shocks are happening to the body and I'm registering it in the eyes alone.
- The changes also include fierce high-frequency head-shaking like I'm saying no repeatedly but can't vocalize or move my body.
- I see this as confirmation of repeated sedated rape and/or worse.
- I'm looking forward to more healing and peace.
- I guess I might remember a whole bunch of things now.
- I remain assured it will be nothing I can't handle.
