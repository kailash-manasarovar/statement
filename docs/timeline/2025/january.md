## Thoughts getting straight

- After three years, and having got rid of my toiletries, I am suddenly starting to see things more clearly.
- I realize that probably I'm going to be murdered by either Domingo Lopez Cano and Hazel Smith's organizations, gitano and British criminal gangs, or the Spanish police, or the British police for their possible collusion.
- I reach out to a Baroness at the House of Lords who supports Women and girls in our fight against the abuses of trans ideology.
- I have had some communication with [Baroness Nicholson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Nicholson,_Baroness_Nicholson_of_Winterbourne) previously.
- She responds with an [email](../../content/documents/emails/the%20witch%20must%20drown-3-6.pdf) saying I'm hysterical.
- So I'll just accept that I'm gonna be murdered or disappeared next week or sometime in the future.
