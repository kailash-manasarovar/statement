## Thoughts getting straight

- After three years, and having got rid of my toiletries, I am suddenly starting to see things more clearly.
- I realize that probably I'm going to be murdered by either Domingo the piano teacher and Hazel Smith's organizations, gitano and British criminal gangs, or the Spanish police, or even the British police for their possible collusion.
- I reach out to a Baroness at the House of Lords who supports women and girls in our fight against the abuses of trans ideology.
- I have had some communication with [Baroness Nicholson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Nicholson,_Baroness_Nicholson_of_Winterbourne) previously.
- She responds with an [email](../../content/documents/emails/the%20witch%20must%20drown-3-6.pdf) saying I'm hysterical.
- So I'll just accept that I'm gonna be murdered or disappeared next week or sometime in the future.

## Twitter translators

- Currently all my tweets are getting few views as usual and a lot of translations.

## Trumpet teacher

- I now believe the trumpet teacher's name is Paco Sendra, the married man [Hazel Smith told she was having an affair with](../early-years/2007.md#hazel-smith) back in 2007.

!!! tip "Correction"
    - Paco Sendra is most likely not the man's name as this is the name of a famous footballer. Possibly Hazel Smith would not have known that at the time.
    - This really is a long game isn't it.

## Max Power

- I get continual info on Twitter over January and late December informing me that the porn brand they are using to distribute whatever porn they make is Max Power, which makes [Samuel's email](../2022/october.md#sam-shares-some-files-with-me) from 2022 quite interesting.
- Indeed, when I do a Google search on this, I notice many of the links that I can see on 1frgvn x google search videos are related to Max Power.

## Paul

- I need someone to help me move from Denia but I struggle to ask people for help, for obvious reasons.

!!! danger "Asking for help"
    - When a sexual abuse victim asks for help they are typically ignored, fastidiously disbelieved, sometimes even attacked, rarely heard.
    - It gets to the stage you realize you have to do everything for yourself.
    - You stop asking for help as it is a waste of time.

- I'm telling my story online and it is alarming some friends.
- A Belgian friend is extremely concerned and says he'll come and help me but he then doesn't contact me for a few days.
- I ask Paul, my [old friend who connected with me the previous June](../2024/june.md#social-media-and-paul), if he will help me go to the police in Madrid, and help me move too.
- He agrees.

!!! danger "Grooming and the CB radio"
    - Paul and a group of boys were groomed over the CB radio by a gay man called Dennis in the 70s.
    - CB radio was the first ever social media and, as you might imagine, pedophiles and predators immediately made use of it to get close to targets.
    - The mass online grooming going on today would have blown their minds.
    - Dennis convinced the boys that he was a decent replacement for their parents, convincing Paul of the utter uselessness of his own father.
    - This group of 14 year old boys would go and hang out with this gay adult male at his house and elsewhere.
    - Paul's parents were horrified, and rightly so, but groomers know very well which children to target and whatever they tried to do about it failed.
    - Paul never got over it and, to this day, he believes Dennis was a force for good in his life.
    - In fact, I believe this is what drew me and Paul together and made drugs and alcohol so appealing; our shared child sexual grooming experiences.

- I meet Paul at Madrid airport.
- He is emaciated; skin and bone.
- He looks like he has been doing seriously hard drugs for decades.
- He reminds me of Winston May's accomplice I saw outside [Rape Crisis Hornsey](../early-years/interim.md#rape-crisis-hornsey).
- Bizarrely, Paul did not come through to the arrivals hall at Madrid airport. Instead, he waits at the shuttle train station for about an hour.
- When I arrive, I call him.
- He's been there over an hour and he sort of pretends he doesn't know where he is or how to get out, and I tell him to come to arrivals as I'm collecting my bag.
- Paul is far from stupid so this behavior concerns me enough to write about it in an earlier commit on the same evening.
- I delete the content later on as Paul does help me a lot and I feel a bit guilty about thinking badly of him.
- I comment on the deletion.

!!! tip "Deleted commit content"
    - Regarding deleted commit content, I'm now unsure of who I can trust anywhere in the world.
    - I believe my fears are exacerbated but given my experience over the last 3 years literally anything could happen.
    - Anything that might be a risk to my life, I have to take measures against, even if the risk appears to be low.

- Paul talks non-stop like a machine gun.
- He seems to be on drugs.
- I'm convinced he's doing serious drugs and has drugs on him, and that he didn't want to come through to arrivals in case he was stopped.
- I'm convinced he waited for me so that he would look more legit walking through with me.
- I wonder if he was given advice about that because it seems an odd thing to think up if you didn't have anything to worry about.
- Paul looks like one of the drug ghouls that used to roam around in a junkie shoal around the Oudekerk in Amsterdam.
- I tell him this and rebook his return flight to go home the next day.
- He is not coming to the police in Madrid with me looking like this.
- He is offended. 
- He has already told me he has diabetes which I believe, but diabetes doesn't make you look like he does, or shout incessantly about nothing.
- He is doing my head in. 
- I'm trying to think.
- I tell him to shut up.
- I feel like someone has told him to distract me constantly so that I do not have a minute to think or collect my thoughts about anything.
- He tells me he is sharing a flat with a man in North London. It turns out he's sleeping on the sofa and the owner is an opium addict.
- I find out later he's living in his car and has been for years.
- He tells me he is not a heroin addict.
- I have to take his word for it.
- Nevertheless, I have no choice but to send him home and go to the police in Madrid without him.
- I give him my coat and a decent woolen jumper and tell him not to sell them.
- I think about the many good people I know in North London whose lives were destroyed by drugs.

### A child sexual abuse survivor gets retraumatized

- I tell Paul later that it is extraordinarily common for people who have been groomed and abused as children to become retraumatized as adults and have breakdowns; specifically when their same-sex kids get to the same age they were when they were groomed by a predator.
- I believe this is what happened to Paul.
- Paul denied the abuse and repeatedly stood up for this random man who had broken up the relationship these boys had with their parents.
- I told him there wasn't a planet in the universe where what Dennis had done was OK.
- Paul was a great guy, one of the best. 
- He, like me, never had any real support from family as they didn't seem to know what was going on for him, and, like me, he was blamed by them for everything that was happening to him that his child's mind couldn't really comprehend.
- It was unfair for him, and me.
- Paul went to pieces around about the same time his second son who he was parenting reached the age that Paul was groomed.
- Paul told me a lot of stories, most of them lies I expect, I hope.
- He did mention that he had met both Charles and Diana on numerous occasions because his grandfather had been the chief librarian at the Times and they came in when he was there.
- He told another story about Diana bumping into him in Camden High Street somewhere when she was hounded by paparazzi and he had caught her and she remembered him.
- Paul told a great deal of porkies while we were together. Some were really nasty stories about people you could tell he was "getting back" for something.
- The stories he told about his grandfather, mostly, I really wanted to be true.

### Paul's friend Lucy

- Paul tells me how I'm one of his best friends in the whole world, that he has only three best friends in the whole world, and I'm one of them.
- He tells me this repeatedly.
- It's weird.
- I haven't seen the man in twenty years.
- Is he trying to butter me up?
- One of the other best friends of Paul's in the whole world is a woman called Lucy.
- He mentions her even more.
- I don't know who she is, but something rings suspicious.
- Something reminds me of [Lucyfer Adams](../2024/december.md#lucyfer-adams).
- I ask Paul how long he's known Lucy. 
- He says a few years.
- He talks about how they go on 50k bicycle rides up to Cheshunt and back, stopping at the pub to drink a few pints.
- Lucy would drink three pints and carry on. Paul would only manage one.
- The thing is, Paul couldn't walk more than about twenty metres without his ankles giving way and he was talking about these bike rides happening just a year or so before.
- He seems to be in constant communication with Lucy on WhatsApp, and he calls her too.
- Paul shows me a picture of Lucy on his phone. It's her WhatsApp profile pic.

### The gay bar

- When I'm back in London prior to going to get my stuff I see Paul a lot.
- One day, we're in the Old White Lion in N2.
- He gets a WhatsApp and suddenly says, let's go somewhere else.
- We head to a bar in Highgate Village which is apparently a gay bar.
- There's no reason for this.
- He explains it's a place he often goes to with [Lucy](#pauls-friend-lucy).
- I'm certain he has been instructed to take me there so I can be "viewed".

## Madrid policia 

- TBC

## Major warning to not drive the car

- I'm getting continuous warnings not to drive the car.
- I picked my friend up from Barajas Airport and drove it to the hotel. My mouth has been dry all night.
- It felt like there was something toxic in the air in the car. It was just 5 minutes.

## Seonaid Dawn and Granny Smith

- Both suspect accounts, mentioned in [fake account list](../../evidence/twitter-account.md#fake-accounts), [Hazel Smith references from May 2024](../2024/may.md#hazel-smith-on-twitter), and elsewhere.

![curious](../../content/tweets/granny-smith-seonaid-barber.png)

- I've now started to block the criminal gang members and porn accounts, including these.

## I call the police

- On my return to London, I call the police to report the numerous crimes that have happened to me while living in Spain at the pleasure of British criminal gangs, and others, there.
- Two female constables turn up to my house. 
- They are totally dismissive in a rather aggressive manner.
- I tell them I was drugged and poisoned and I have samples. They said it happened in Spain so they're not interested.
- I tell them all my devices are hacked and I have been surveilled continuously for years. They say it happened in Spain so they're not interested.
- I explain it was happening all over the world. They don't care.
- I explain it is happening now, in England. They don't care.
- I tell them I've been to the police numerous times in Spain and they don't care.
- Not our problem, they say.
- I tell them I have been shown flashed images of rape-porn I was in as a child.
- They say, "show us", and obviously I can't.
- I tell them, "they're not stupid, they're not going to give me evidence for that but I know it was me."
- If you can't show us, we're not interested.
- I tell them I'm being continually threatened online on X.
- I show them some of the online threats I've endured, including the picture of my brother with RIP below it. They tell me nothing I have shown them is a threat.
- The blond one keeps cutting me off and saying, forcefully, "You haven't shown us anything, just show us something".
- I try to but everything I say is cut off as not being criminal.
- Whenever I try to slow them down and deal with what I do have methodically, they start to rush me, demanding I show them something, and changing the subject when I'm trying to explain something to them.
- It's very unpleasant.
- I tell them British children are in danger in Spain. They're not interested.
- I tell them I was stalked by North London rape-gang members I had already told the police about while I was campaigning for election in July.
- They want to know who I stood for in the election. I tell them; Party of Women. 
- They tell me the criminal gang members can go wherever they like. It's not a crime.
- It's so incongruent, I ask them if they've been told to dismiss everything I'm saying by someone.
- They get annoyed.
- I take their numbers down on my hacked laptop. The blond one says, "Oh, wait, we'll write it down for you." I say, no no, let me put your numbers in here. She still wants to write the numbers down for me. I wonder why she doesn't want me to write their details into my hacked laptop.
- I realize they are going to do nothing for me, as usual, so I let them leave. They were trying to get away from the minute we started to speak. They stayed 20 minutes.

## Seeking asylum in another country

- I am clearly unsafe in the United Kingdom as well as Spain and France, and especially in North London where my family live.
- I access the Israel website for asylum seekers and try to make an application.
- My web access is continuously blocked.
- I give up.
