## Thoughts getting straight

- After three years, and having got rid of my toiletries, I am suddenly starting to see things more clearly.
- I realize that probably I'm going to be murdered by either Domingo the piano teacher and Hazel Smith's organizations, gitano and British criminal gangs, or the Spanish police, or even the British police for their possible collusion.
- I reach out to a Baroness at the House of Lords who supports women and girls in our fight against the abuses of trans ideology.
- I have had some communication with [Baroness Nicholson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Nicholson,_Baroness_Nicholson_of_Winterbourne) previously.
- She responds with an [email](../../content/documents/emails/the%20witch%20must%20drown-3-6.pdf) saying I'm hysterical.
- So I'll just accept that I'm gonna be murdered or disappeared next week or sometime in the future.

## Twitter translators

- Currently all my tweets are getting few views as usual and a lot of translations.

## Trumpet teacher

- I now believe the trumpet teacher's name is Paco Sendra, the married man [Hazel Smith told she was having an affair with](../early-years/2007.md#hazel-smith) back in 2007.

!!! tip "Correction"
    - Paco Sendra is clearly not the man's name as this is the name of a famous footballer. Possibly Hazel Smith would not have known that at the time.
    - This really is a long game isn't it.

## Max Power

- I get continual info on Twitter over January and late December informing me that the porn brand they are using to distribute whatever porn they make is Max Power, which makes [Samuel's email](../2022/october.md#sam-shares-some-files-with-me) from 2022 quite interesting.
- Indeed, when I do a Google search on this, I notice many of the links that I can see on 1frgvn x google search videos are related to Max Power.

## Major warning to not drive the car

- I'm getting continuous warnings not to drive the car.
- I picked my friend up from Barajas Airport and drove it to the hotel. My mouth has been dry all night.
- It felt like there was something toxic in the air in the car. It was just 5 minutes.

## My friend

- Regarding deleted commit content, I'm now unsure of who I can trust anywhere in the world.
- I believe my fears are exacerbated but given my experience over the last 3 years literally anything could happen.
- Anything that might be a risk to my life, I have to take measures against, even if the risk appears to be low.

## Seonaid Dawn and Granny Smith

- Both suspect accounts, mentioned in [fake account list](../../evidence/twitter-account.md#fake-accounts), [Hazel Smith references from May 2024](../2024/may.md#hazel-smith-on-twitter), and elsewhere.

- I've now started to block the criminal gang members and porn accounts, including these.

## I call the police

- On my return to London, I call the police to report the numerous crimes that have happened to me while living in Spain at the pleasure of British criminal gangs, and others, there.
- Two female constables turn up to my house. 
- They are totally dismissive in a rather aggressive manner.
- I tell them I was drugged and poisoned and I have samples. They said it happened in Spain so they're not interested.
- I tell them all my devices are hacked and I have been surveilled continuously for years. They say it happened in Spain so they're not interested.
- I explain it was happening all over the world. They don't care.
- I explain it is happening now, in England. They don't care.
- I tell them I've been to the police numerous times in Spain and they don't care.
- Not our problem, they say.
- I show them some of the online threats I've endured, including the picture of my brother with RIP below it. They tell me nothing I have shown them is a threat.
- The blond one keeps cutting me off and saying, forcefully, "You haven't shown us anything, just show us something".
- I try to but everything I say is cut off as not being criminal.
- It's very unpleasant.
- I tell them British children are in danger in Spain. They're not interested.
- I tell them I was stalked by criminal rape-gang members while I was campaigning for election in July.
- They want to know who I stood for in the election. I tell them; Party of Women. 
- They tell me the criminal gang members can go wherever they like. It's not a crime.
- It's so incongruent, I ask them if they've been told to dismiss everything I'm saying by someone.
- They get annoyed.
- I take their numbers down on my hacked laptop. The blond one says, "Oh, wait, we'll write it down for you." I say, no no, let me put your numbers in here. She still wants to write the numbers down for me. I wonder why she doesn't want me to write their details into my hacked laptop.
- I realize they are going to do nothing for me, as usual, so I let them leave. They were trying to get away from the minute we started to speak. They stayed 20 minutes.
