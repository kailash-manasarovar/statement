## Suicide content on my `@JackChardwood` account

- You may remember in [January 2024](../2024/january.md#jackchardwood), my `@JackChardwood` X feed went from one content type to another, literally over night.
- This also happened with my `@1frgvn` account repeatedly, but not so starkly; the account has much more activity anyway.
- Nevertheless, I would notice sudden [excessive and inexplicable porn content](../2023/june.md#the-excessive-porn-on-x-begins) on both timelines on a regular basis, often during the evenings.
- On these occasions, the *only* accounts posting anything on my timeline seemed to be aggressive stalker fake-accounts; her [flying monkeys](../2024/march/1-12.md#online-stalkers), as it were.
- Clearly, any device's hacked browser's social media feeds can be 100% manipulated, and the manipulation can take multiple forms.
- I can practically see a bunch of criminal stalker apps targeting each social media platform; now probably rolled into one single application that criminal gangs use.
- Hacking a device is pretty easy, and young boys studying CS do it *all the time*; making sure the girls never find out how it works.
- Once in and jumping into an open session as owner, manipulating everything the true owner sees must be very easy.
- However, it's one thing a youngster doing it with a simple hacker application, it's quite another to have access to these AI-based process-heavy highly professional distributed applications that bypass safeguarding censorship completely.
- It also appears that X (the only platform I'm familiar with) has some leaky code on the backend which allows criminals to tweak the algorithm for targeted users. Sounds like an inside job.
- Criminals must prompt the application to post the triggering content required.
- For example, in my case, here's an idea of how those varying prompts might have read:
    - Animated, non-hostile porn with fellatio and post-coitus bliss ensuring man is [add particular size, shape, coloring] and woman is [add here].
    - Insipid Indian self-help bro content.
    - Wild out-there hallucinogen-type content from space bros.
    - Cat posts with messages that read like a true romance; with 5% of those posts having a random threat towards a female user.
    - Violent porn with aggression and threat towards a viewer we assume is female.
    - Subtle sexual grooming content for [add gender and age] who likes animals.
    - Etc.
- Once prompted, the target's timeline changes completely. 
- It's very clever, quite obvious too, unless you're a kid, I guess.
- A smart target might notice and wonder what was going on.
- There may be adjustable subtlety levels; I suspect the less obvious it is the more powerful hold it has.
- If you happen to be able to drug a target at the same time, or perhaps know that they're a pothead or similar, then this triggering mechanism will have even more potency.
- So, why am I mentioning this here?
- Well, since I remembered the [anal fissure I noticed when my dad visited me in 2015](../early-years/2015.md#colitis-symptoms) about two weeks ago, my `@JackChardwood` account has undergone another of these transformation.
- Suicide content. A whole bunch of it.
- I take this as confirmation from the criminal porn gangs of Dénia that, just like [Alicia said about Bali](../2024/may.md#alicia), the *worst thing ever* happened.
- The townsfolk and one other were the *only* ones who knew the real reason I became suicidally depressed in 2015; perhaps they're hoping for a bit of that again.
- Sorry not sorry folks. Not going to happen.
- Furthermore, this suicide content on my feed I have never seen before supports my suspicion that Lorraine Blackbourn, and others in the area and at the conservatory, have been manipulated online into committing suicide.
- Another view of some of the less unpleasant of these changes in content is that someone was/is doing a bit of show-and-tell for my benefit.
- Thank you, whoever you are. It has helped enormously.
