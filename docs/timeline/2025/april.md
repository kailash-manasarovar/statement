## Goaded online

- I continue to be goaded online, specifically about illnesses related to pesticide poisoning.
- It's nothing like it was though. 
- Everything is pretty quiet online.
- I suspect it's Carmen Cano, as they like you to know who they are, and this name and her picture keeps coming up in the way they used to.
