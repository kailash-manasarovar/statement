## Goaded online

- I continue to be goaded online, specifically about illnesses related to pesticide poisoning.
- It's nothing like it was though. 
- Everything is pretty quiet online.
- I suspect it's Carmen Cano, as they like you to know who they are, and this name and her picture keeps coming up in the way they used to.
- Sources tell me this woman has been waiting for me to die for some time. She'll need eternity for that I expect.

## There's something in the water

- I take my father to play a jazz gig. He has been unwell so we have a blue badge and I can park right outside the pub.
- He finds walking hard since he was a little paralyzed by a pain-killing injection he received after falling last October.
- I leave him there, and go to collect him at about 11pm.
- We're walking out of the pub and towards the car.
- A couple of people, a youngish short woman with blond hair who was with someone else, steam past us. 
- She is saying loudly, "There's something in the water. There's something in the water."
- I think I recognize her.
- Lucy.

## Ireland

- I set off early in the morning to make the long drive to the ferry to Ireland.
- I'm off to do a TEB advanced training focusing on the lymphatic system.
- I get to the top of my road and there is a huge mean looking man standing glaring at me from across the road.
- I ignore him.
- He thinks I don't see him.
