## Goaded online

- I continue to be goaded online, specifically about illnesses related to pesticide poisoning.
- It's nothing like it was though. 
- Everything is pretty quiet online.
- I suspect it's Carmen Cano, as they like you to know who they are, and this name and her picture keeps coming up in the way they used to.
- Sources tell me this woman has been waiting for me to die for some time. She'll need eternity for that I expect.

## Fridges

- At one point, there is communication online with regards to how I've had enough and I'm not playing anymore.
- The following day, I do a Google search on my X name and all I see is fridges.
- I'm reminded of Domingo Cano telling everyone at the conservatory I was [frigid](../early-years/2014.md#poisoned-aunts) and wonder if that's something his other targets are very familiar with on their social media?

## There's something in the water

- I take my father to play a jazz gig at the Elephant pub in North Finchley.
- He has been unwell so we have a blue badge and I can park right outside the pub.
- He finds walking hard since he was a little paralyzed by a pain-killing injection he received after falling last October.
- I leave him there, and go to collect him at about 11pm.
- We're walking out of the pub and towards the car.
- A couple of people, a youngish short woman with blond hair who was with someone else, steam past us. 
- She is saying loudly, "There's something in the water. There's something in the water."
- I think I recognize her.
- It's [Lucy](january.md#pauls-friend-lucy).
- Paul's "friend".
- I recognize her because he showed me her picture on his phone.
- The jeering is, obviously, a reference to the poisoning at my Spanish apartment.

## Let Women Speak April

- I go to Hyde Park Let Women Speak on 27th April.
- Susan and Sandra are there.
- I had seen them both in [Aberdeen in March](march.md#let-women-speak-aberdeen).
- Sandra was an [electoral volunteer](../2024/june.md#volunteers-not-what-they-seem) of mine in 2024.
- Between the previous time I saw them in March, and this event, I had remembered that Susan Hamill had [repeated a significant phrase from my police statement](../2023/may.md#chamber-music-concert) exactly like teachers and staff had done at the conservatory of Denia while terrorizing me.
- I felt a little uneasy.
- The first thing Susan says to me is, "oh do you want an icecream?", and she goes to get icecreams for her and Sandra.
- I declined and thought there was something weird going on.
- We went to the pub.
- I buy Susan a pint for her birthday, and one for me.
- We sit down.
- I'm talking to other people.
- I have drunk a few sips of my pint and suddenly Susan says, "do you want a chaser?".
- I'm a bit surprised and say no.
- A few minutes later, while I'm chatting with someone, she puts a full pint down before me which I don't really want but I feel I've no choice but to accept.
- Susan and Sandra leave. 
- When I get home that night I become extremely unwell.
- I spend two days in bed vomiting profusely.
- My whole family also get sick in the same way which is particularly concerning.
- My father was first to get sick, on the Friday evening after we had fish and chips in Muswell Hill.
- The following Monday, Susan posts a picture of a single pint on a pub table with no-one around on the LWS WhatsApp group chat.
- The next time I see Sandra at LWS in May, I'm extremely standoffish.
- On X, I see a post that evening, "Don't be rude".
- I respond a week later after thinking about it.

![Support the pedo rape gangs](../../content/tweets/support-pedo-rape-gangs.png)

- It feels to me that certain vested interests are very keen for me to not attend Let Women Speak rallies, to be afraid to go, to feel in fear for my safety.
- I assume those vested interests must be somehow protecting the pedophile rape gangs that stole my life from me and countless other women and girls, and men and boys too no doubt.
- Sometimes, at Let Women Speak rallies, it feels like the only people attending are spies.

## Ireland

- I set off early in the morning to make the long drive to the ferry to Ireland.
- I'm off to do a TEB advanced training focusing on the lymphatic system.
- I get to the top of my road and there is a huge mean looking man standing glaring at me from across the road.
- I ignore him.
- He thinks I don't see him.
