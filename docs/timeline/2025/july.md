## ChatGPT

- ChatGPT breaks for me whenever I'm drawing something explosive.
- Whenever ChatGPT draws an image as if it was there at the time, such as with the [smug guy at the conservatory](../../timeline/2023/november.md#weird-guy-at-the-conservatory), I get weird responses online, or I am denied access to ChatGPT for 720 hours.
- I'm loving it, personally.
- ToT!

## The woman at the Red Lion

- Dad and I go to the Red Lion for a Sunday dinner.
- We sit down.
- A woman comes and sits next to us.
- She is over-talkative but not-friendly.
- She reminds me a little of the [white man interrogating the Asians](march.md#a-man-who-reminds-me-of-domingo) from before.
- As we leave, she makes an unnecessary hand-gesture to me which is just one of a million things I did that the teachers and staff at the conservatory jeered at.
- Interesting.
