## ChatGPT

- ChatGPT breaks for me whenever I'm drawing something explosive.
- Whenever ChatGPT draws an image as if it was there at the time, such as with the [smug guy at the conservatory](../../timeline/2023/november.md#weird-guy-at-the-conservatory), I get weird responses online, or I am denied access to ChatGPT for 720 hours.
- This is on desktop only.

## The woman at the Red Lion

- Dad and I go to the Red Lion in High Barnet for a Sunday dinner.
- We sit down.
- A woman comes and sits next to us.
- She is over-talkative but not-friendly.
- She reminds me a little of the [white man interrogating the Asians](march.md#a-man-who-reminds-me-of-domingo) from before.
- As we leave, she makes an unnecessary hand-gesture to me which is just one of a million things I did that the teachers and staff at the conservatory jeered at.
- The bar staff address the woman by name.
- We thought she might be the boss. 
- Just like the guy from March, she had the air of someone who only speaks to people who are very afraid of her.

## Lourdes

- I visit Lourdes.
- As I check into my hotel, the Arcades, two people walk past me after speaking with reception.
- One of those people is the woman to the left of this pic.
- She speaks perfect French to the receptionist.
- She is walking on crutches.

![Taya](../../content/images/domingo-target-mother-advertisement.jpg)

- Later, on X, she introduces herself as Taya.
- At the hotel, she is with a tech I suppose; a man of about 20 with black hair and very pale skin. 
- He is dressed in black.
- The following day, they come to the restaurant for dinner, just after I have arrived to eat.
- She no longer has crutches.
- As she walks past the waitress, she says something like "oh, I don't need my crutches anymore, it must be a miracle".
- I see the waitress sort of whirl backwards a bit as they brush past her.
- The waitress goes off sick and doesn't return. 
- It is now 7 days she is off sick. She had a very bad cough. This might be irrelevant.
- I believe it is *highly* likely these two came into my room to add substances to my toiletries or whatever it is they do.
- They must be *going equipped* at all times.
- My eye health has deteriorated massively this week in Lourdes.
- Having been to police and doctors all over Europe about being stalked and poisoned over the last years, my sudden-onset pre-glaucoma condition amongst other things, and literally no-one wants to help me, I have no other option but to write it down.
- Are they trying to blind me so that I can't continue to write?
- There is a lot of activity on X, especially after I post a response to all this.

![Taya toll](../../content/images/taya-toll.png)

- Some threatening follows also.

![Threatening ugly](../../content/images/a-tadge-menacing.png)

- I have seen this profile photo before during menacing communications.
- I check the profile message.

![Ugly](../../content/images/a-tadge-menacing-2.png)

- The message, "Ugly", I presume to be reference to being followed the previous summer in Lourdes and Cauterets, something [I already wrote about](https://fearandloathinginlasmarinas.com/timeline/2024/august/#followed-by-the-gypsy-in-france), and maybe posted about, we will see.

### Constant confirmation I'm being watched

- Over these 10 days in Lourdes I see posts and account messages confirming I'm being watched, and very closely too.
- I see posts referring to my belly size which makes me think they've installed a spy-cam in my room.
- I see posts related to how I look, what I'm wearing, things in the town, decorations at the hotel, the amount of mosquitoes in the hotel.
- It's endless.

!!! tip "Videos"
    - I tried to get videos of them at dinner.
    - I added the videos I did get to the repo:
        - [1]() 
        - [2]()
        - [3]()  

## More threats

- I also see threatening pics on my mobile device which remind me very much of [the violent threats I received on X in March 2024](../2024/march.md#twitter-screenshots).

![Violent images](../../content/images/violent-images.png)

- I can't describe how exhausting it is to be constantly stalked by multiple gypsies who probably don't even know the why of it anymore.
- If I didn't have God, I'd fear their murderous and vile intentions, and from time to time I do fear it.
- I pray all this is over soon.

## The Benijembla woman

- In November 2022, while walking with the English ladies, a choreographed scene was set up for my benefit.
- I write about it [here](../2022/november.md#walking-in-benijembla-with-the-english-ladies).
- I noticed a woman with the trumpet teacher on that afternoon.
- I see pictures of her on X, again and again, in profile photos and elsewhere.
- Even in July 2025, hackers post her pic.
- Here's a couple.

![Benijembla lady 1](../../content/images/fake-accounts/woman%20in%20benijembla.png)
![Benijembla lady 1](../../content/images/fake-accounts/missus.png)

- I'm led to believe it is TT's wife - the dangerous TT - but it's never clear what they want me to think.
- The implication is usually that she's been doing porn.
- I may even have an X account with a profile picture of her as a young girl of about 13 maybe. 
- Could this be her too?

![Young missus](../../content/images/targeted-women/car-woman/5.png)

![Young missus](../../content/images/targeted-women/car-woman/6.png)

- Could her name be Maggie Harrington?

![Maggie Harrington](../../content/images/fake-accounts/maggie-harrington.png)

## Viscos

- I see the Viscos peak from [my temporary chair](../../content/videos/viscos-from-my-chair.mov).
- The lightning feels like a wave back; "I noticed you too".
- So nice.
