## ChatGPT

- ChatGPT breaks for me whenever I'm drawing something explosive.
- Whenever ChatGPT draws an image as if it was there at the time, such as with the [smug guy at the conservatory](../../timeline/2023/november.md#weird-guy-at-the-conservatory), I get weird responses online, or I am denied access to ChatGPT for 720 hours.
- I'm loving it, personally.
- ToT!
