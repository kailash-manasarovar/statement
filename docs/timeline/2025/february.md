## Paul helps me move back to UK

- I have no one else to help me, so I ask [Paul](january.md#paul) if he would like an all expenses paid trip to Spain and back to help me collect my stuff.
- He agrees.
- I meet Paul at Madrid airport and we drive down to Denia to collect my stuff.
- I ask him if he will have a look around the flat for anything suspicious and I tell him about the hole in the wall behind the mirror.
- When we look, there's no massive hole in the wall; its a rather tiny hole in fact.
- I realize I was hallucinating *hard* in October 2024 to have seen a fist-sized hole in the wall.
- I'm horrified.
- I ask Paul to look around to see if there is any evidence of tampering with the plumbing or the TV.
- He tells me everything is normal, but he is unconvincing.
- He tells me that if he takes the back off the TV it'll break it and he won't be able to get it back on.
- I don't believe him.
- He tells me the odd-looking piping in the kitchen is normal.
- Paul shows me messages from his friend Lucy about her new girlfriends.
- He even shows me a rather pornographic photo that she's sent him.
- I'm rather appalled and don't really know what's going on but know it's all very uncool.

### Child gang-rape porn

- I tell Paul the whole story about what's been going on and how it is related to when I was sexually abused as a child.
- I tell him I think the Adams family are involved.
- He tells me he went to school with one of them; a male who committed suicide.
- I tell him I was right to be suspicious of him.

### Lourdes

- We stop at Lourdes.

### London

- We arrive back in London.
- I'm driving Paul back to his car where he lives.
- It's late and we're both tired.
- As we pull up to the junction at the bottom of Muswell Hill, the light goes green but it is not signalling right so I don't go.
- Paul says, go go, it's green, so I move forward, but there is oncoming traffic so I can't turn right.
- I break and ride the clutch a little bit but the car won't move, it is revving hard, but not moving, and I'm trying to go in and out of first, and I can smell this awful smell.
- Paul pulled the handbrake button without my knowledge.
- I leave Paul at his car and thank him for saving my life.
- I drive home alone.
- At some point a car pulls out in front of me and I end up following it all the way to Church Lane N2.
- It's number plate is XXXX WTF. (The Xs are numbers I can't remember.)

## Moving back to UK

- I spend most of February moving my stuff back to my house in London.
- It's all rather traumatic.
- I start to find evidence that all my belongings have been tampered with and this could only have happened if people had access to my apartment.

### My belongings have been doused in pesticides

- I realize all my belongings have been doused in pesticides or similar.

### My conservatory papers

- All formal conservatory notifications for the years 2022-23, and 2023-24, are missing from my files.
- Fortunately, I have kept copies of everything.
