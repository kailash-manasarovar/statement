## Moving back to UK

- I spend most of February moving my stuff back to my house in London.
- It's all rather traumatic.
- I start to find evidence that all my belongings have been tampered with and this could only have happened if people had access to my apartment.

### My belongings have been doused in pesticides

- I realize all my belongings have been doused in pesticides or similar.

### My conservatory papers

- All formal conservatory notifications for the years 2022-23, and 2023-24, are missing from my files.
- Fortunately, I have kept copies of everything.
