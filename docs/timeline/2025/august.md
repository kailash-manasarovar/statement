## A song to the mountains

- The mountains give me time to reflect and get my head straight.
- They whisper their secrets, as usual.
- My health is a shadow of what it was a year previous due to the poisoning but I'm still here so I'm grateful.
- I give every breath to God and thank Him for saving my life.
- I do some high-altitude hiking to build up strength and fitness again.
- I throw away a lot of stuff I think the [gypsy woman poisoned at Lourdes](july.md#eyes-and-kidneys-again-and-heart-now-too), but something is still giving me RA in my hands, I'm not sure what it could be.
- It stopped for a few days when I was serving Mary, and then started up again.
- Could it be my computer keyboard?

## Haircut

- I go for my regular haircut with the exceptionally good hairdressers here in Cauterets.
- I wonder if [whatever Sandra told them](../2024/september.md#the-hairdresser) the year before will be *in the air*.
- It is.
- The hairdresser gives me a hack-job and appears to be angry with me.
- I'm amazed.
- I was wondering if maybe Sandra was so sure I'd be destroyed I'd never return, she told them I was terminally sick or something like that.
- But I think it was something more insidious.
- I tweet about it.

- A message flies by "Oh we know what it was, we know, we know!"
