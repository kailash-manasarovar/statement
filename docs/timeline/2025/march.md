## Researching the book

- It's time to knuckle down and finish editing this statement in preparation for publishing it as a novel.

## Reaching out to journalists

- I reach out to multiple journalists with my story; none gets back to me.
- I found out that Deborah Davies made a [documentary film about the black Caribbean rape-gangs in 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dispatches_episodes).

!!! quote "Teenage Gang Rape, a film by Deborah Davies"
    12 November Teenage Gang Rape, a documentary about teenage gang rape, finds that most cases of gang rape in UK are committed by black youths; some perpetrators were aged no more than 11; reported by Deborah Davies; on 19 November 1998, there was a protest outside the headquarters of Channel 4 by the National Assembly Against Racism.

- The film sparked a huge row and protest which Diane Abbot and others attended and so the matter was successfully suppressed just like the Pakistani rape-gang phenomena has been.
- Here's the Independent [making light of it all](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/rape-race-and-fragments-of-truth-1186539.html) at the time.
- I thought Deborah might be interested in my story.
- I sent her an email.

- This is the kind of email I have sent to scores of journalists and interested parties.

??? tip "Email to Deborah Davies"
    Hi,

    Massive news tip https://statement-bhw.pages.dev/

    Report contains details of (non exhaustive list) 

    1. What happens to the victims of black rape gangs (sedating porn mainly) in 1980s/90s who survive and keep going to the police who ignore them but instead inform criminal gangs about them who then stalk and target them endlessly ...
    2. The frenzy when said victim stands for general election in the UK
    3. The bigger frenzy when said victim uncovers massive crime networks in Spain that target expats for their inheritance on death and/or via sexploitation and have been operational for decades
    4. How British criminal gangs infiltrated these networks and introduced poisoning and sedating tactics (see the reference to Hazel and Sandra Smith from another channel 4 documentary shown in 1998)
    5. How parts of Spain are now mass spycam porn studios
    6. How these criminal gangs have infiltrated schools and learning establishments to target minors either for preparation for porn etc or worse now.

    Feel free to get in touch anytime. I have just moved back to uk and believe my things have been sprayed in pesticides as I am suffering a sudden onset rheumatoid arthritis of some variety and it is their MO ...

    I'm updating this statement constantly as I remember things. Obviously police are keen to discredit and ignore me for obvious reasons.

    Thanks

    Katharine 

## Let Women Speak Aberdeen

- I travel to [Let Women Speak in Aberdeen](https://www.letwomenspeak.org/event-details/let-women-speak-aberdeen).
- Sandra, one of my [electoral volunteers](../2024/june.md#volunteers-not-what-they-seem) and her sister Susan are there.
- Susan and I spend some time talking over drinks at the party.
- She tells me she would be pearly queen if they still existed as they are her ancestors.
- I have forgotten Susan owns an X account which *significantly* repeated a phrase from my sexual abuse statement as I was reporting it, on December 5th, Winston May's birthday, in 2024.

![Are you OK](../../content/images/are-u-okay.png)

- If you have forgotten about the "Are you OK" significance, please reread the [chamber music concert](../2023/may.md#chamber-music-concert) section from May 2023.
- Susan tells me she has had kidney failure for over 10 years but her doctors only just told her.

## A man who reminds me of Domingo

- My father and I go to the Red Lion pub in Barnet for a meal.
- It is a Wednesday and very quiet, only we are there to eat.
- We sit in a quiet table for two. No-one else is around.
- Suddenly, a white man comes and sits in the round table next to us.
- He is joined by numerous Asian men, maybe four or five, who sit around him.
- He has a kind of camp voice and he barks questions at the men relentlessly.
- How are your children? What's your wife doing now? Are you still studying? Each question like the firing of a bullet.
- The men are below him in rank, somehow, and they all answer him respectfully, reverently even.
- Before a man has finished answering a question, the main dude barks another one out, as if he's not really listening, or doesn't care.
- The bar staff address the man by name.
- The main dude reminds me of someone, but I don't place it for a few weeks.
- It's Domingo.
- The whole scene reminded me of the time we went out for dinner at the Japanese restaurant in Dénia and he kind of *performed* for the people sitting around the table, as if he knew them and they had to respect him, even though his behavior was rather ignorant, in my view.
- The way he spoke, as if everyone had no choice but to listen to him and smile and agree was exactly what I saw at the Red Lion.
- Who was this overbearing, slightly camp 50-year-old white man with a moustache presiding over a table of Asian men who may well have been second-generation Pakistanis?
- And why did they sit right beside us instead of in one of the more private areas elsewhere?
- Are they trying to make deals?

## Moorfields Eye Hospital

- Given I've had a diagnosis of pre-glaucoma from [Rutnin Eye Hospital in Bangkok](../2024/november.md#pre-glaucoma-eye-condition), I need the same in the UK so it's on my NHS record.
- I arrange an appointment at Moorfields in Brent Cross.
- Something weird is going on at the appointment.
- I'm met by a male clinician who talks to me in an extremely strange way, like he's acting.
- He speaks in a low voice, hurriedly, and repeats himself over and over.
- He tells me that it doesn't matter, we're not going to do the in-depth tests, we don't need to dilate my eyes or look closely inside.
- I say I was expecting to have the full investigation like in Bangkok, and the letter told me to expect that.
- He tells me he doesn't understand why the letter says this, it shouldn't have said this, he says something silly about things never getting updated and giggles.
- I'm surprised by all this, including his behavior.
- It's tiring having to think the worst of everyone all the time, and I don't want to do that, so I assume everything's OK with what they're going to test.
- Another man takes me through the series of tests.
- There's something going on though.
- These two men are a bit snickery and giggly with each other, like they're winking and grinning at me.
- Something's happening that they're not telling me about, and it's important I should know.
- They remind me of countless situations I've been in over the last few years where people seem to know more about me than I do, and none of it is good.
- Have they seen the porn I'm in? The snickering would suggest so.
- When I do the peripheral test, I notice I can hardly see any dots in the left peripheral.
- They don't dilate and investigate further.
- When I get the results, a few weeks later, they say I'm fine and I don't need any further investigation; but they do make a point of saying my angles are indeed narrow.

## Conservatory news

- On [Dénia.com](https://www.denia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/firmas-recogidas-para-un-nuevo-conservatorio-de-musica-en-denia-scaled.jpg) there is a report on a petition raised regarding a new building for the conservatory.

![Conservatory petition](../../content/images/conservatory-teachers.jpg)

- From left-to-right, Joan Carles piano teacher, Jaume Signes trumpet teacher and director of the school, Paqui Fornet piano teacher, and Rosa Vidal vice director.
- All of them will be aware of what happened to me, how I was targeted and why and by whom, and they all played their own little parts in tormenting a student, commendably.
- One wonders how a small town's music school could cope with a major scandal related to grooming and terrorizing students.
