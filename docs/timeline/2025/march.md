## Researching the book

- It's time to knuckle down and finish editing this statement in preparation for publishing it as a novel.

## Let Women Speak Aberdeen

- I travel to [Let Women Speak in Aberdeen](https://www.letwomenspeak.org/event-details/let-women-speak-aberdeen).
- Sandra, one of my [electoral volunteers](../2024/june.md#volunteers-not-what-they-seem) and her sister Susan are there.
- Susan and I spend some time talking over drinks at the party.
- She tells me she would be pearly queen if they still existed as they are her ancestors.
- I have forgotten Susan owns an X account which *significantly* repeated a phrase from my sexual abuse statement as I was reporting it, on December 5th, Winston May's birthday, in 2024.

- If you have forgotten about the "Are you OK" significance, please reread the [chamber music concert](../2023/may.md#chamber-music-concert) section from May 2023.
- Susan tells me she has had kidney failure for over 10 years but her doctors only just told her.

## A man who reminds me of Domingo

- My father and I go to the Red Lion pub in Barnet for a meal.
- It is a Wednesday and very quiet, only we are there to eat.
- We sit in a quiet table for two. No-one else is around.
- Suddenly, a white man comes and sits in the round table next to us.
- He is joined by numerous Asian men, maybe four or five, who sit around him.
- He has a kind of camp voice and he barks questions at the men relentlessly.
- How are your children? What's your wife doing now? Are you still studying? Each question like the firing of a bullet.
- The men are below him in rank, somehow, and they all answer him respectfully, reverently even.
- Before a man has finished answering a question, the main dude barks another one out, as if he's not really listening, or doesn't care.
- The bar staff address the man by name.
- The main dude reminds me of someone, but I don't place it for a few weeks.
- It's Domingo.
- The whole scene reminded me of the time we went out for dinner at the Japanese restaurant in Dénia and he kind of *performed* for the people sitting around the table, as if he knew them and they had to respect him, even though his behavior was rather ignorant, in my view.
- The way he spoke, as if everyone had no choice but to listen to him and smile and agree was exactly what I saw at the Red Lion.
- Who was this overbearing, slightly camp 50-year-old white man with a moustache presiding over a table of Asian men who may well have been second-generation Pakistanis?
- And why did they sit right beside us instead of in one of the more private areas elsewhere?
- Are they trying to make deals?

## Conservatory news

- On [Dénia.com](https://www.denia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/firmas-recogidas-para-un-nuevo-conservatorio-de-musica-en-denia-scaled.jpg) there is a report on a petition raised regarding a new building for the conservatory.

![Conservatory petition](../../content/images/conservatory-teachers.jpg)

- From left-to-right, Joan Carles piano teacher, Jaume Signes trumpet teacher and director of the school, Paqui Fornet piano teacher, and Rosa Vidal vice director.
- All of them will be aware of what happened to me, how I was targeted and why and by whom, and they all played their own little parts in tormenting a student, commendably.
- One wonders how a small town's music school could cope with a major scandal related to grooming and terrorizing students.
