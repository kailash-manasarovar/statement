## Thailand fasting and detox clarity

- It's day seven of the fast and detox program.
- I'm feeling well and free of a lot of poison and toxins.
- I go for a nap in the afternoon.
- I'm not tired, I just need to rest for a bit.
- I've been lying down a short while and I suddenly see something in my mind's eye which causes me unease.
- I'm in my bed at Carrer Furs.
- Sitting on the left side of the bed to me is a man, he has no shirt on.
- I can't see if he is wearing anything on his bottom half as my duvet is in the way.
- He has the build of the swimmer in the [`@jctot19` profile](https://x.com/JCToT19/), but older and with a more defined musculature.

- He would match most closely the build of [Marc, number two trumpet teacher](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#mark-from-english-class-in-2013), the man who turned up to class the most.
- He is wearing a face paint mask.
- It looked like the top-half of his face is painted in a sort of demonish black with vertical thin white stripes coming down his forehead. 
- I can see no facially defining features.
- He is screaming and shouting and shaking his head around in a most bizarre manner.
- In his hand he has what looks like one of my kitchen tea towels (is this where we get [the towel meme](../2024/march/13-end.md#an-account-i-believe-is-run-by-domingo-cano-the-piano-teacher) they've been using since 13th March).
- He is holding it taut at both ends, and stretching it, and twisting it.
- He slaps the bed with it.
- Rather like the [Jitendra Das lookalike did at the Polygon conference in Bali](../2024/may.md#the-pakistani-yorkshire-man).
- It feels too distressing and so I get up.
