## Hazel Smith on Twitter

- This account was likely Hazel, or her mum, as we had a long chat: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1785410648802734485.
- The English on many of the stalker accounts was native. It could have been anyone in the region I suppose, except this account knew things that only myself and Hazel (or people who know her intimately) would know.
- The account profile pic is the face of my chamber music teacher that year, Esteve, which means that Hazel must be connected to Domingo in some way.
- Esteve was a genuinely nice man in my opinion.

## The laundry

- I go to the laundry to dry my clothes.
- A man comes in who recognizes me. I have no idea who he is.
- I email my mother and tell her.

## Cars beeping outside

- Every day, in the morning and around lunchtime, a couple of cars will drive by and beep their horns when they're level with my apartment.
- One of the cars looks like the same car as was [lingering outside my flats in February](january.md#threatening-men-outside).
- One of the cars was a grey Mercedes sedan, or similar, sporty.

## Climbing the Montgo

- I climb the Montgo one Saturday afternoon.
- Close to the top, I "bump" into Ana Requena, the violin teacher. She is with a husky dog and a short, slightly built man.
- I realize it was this man in the [blue car incident](../2023/november.md#ana-in-the-blue-van), ducking down so he wouldn't be seen.
- I also remember him from meeting [Paul and Alessandra back in September 2023](../2023/september.md#alex-and-paul) in a cafe as one of the people who suddenly sat down beside us.
- She says hello in an angry way. 
- I find it utterly ironic and wonder if all Spanish people are psychopaths.

## Beams

- An account has been interact with my @JackChardwood account in an usual way: https://x.com/search?q=%20(to%3Ajackchardwood)(from%3Abeams_game)&src=typed_query&f=live
- The interaction runs from 26th April to 31st May.
- The account's name is `@Beams_Game`.

![Beams](../../content/images/beams-games.png){width=65%}

- There is some tweetage and we DM too.
- He talks candidly about his extremely violent father. Much of this content is deleted now.
- On 8th May he posts "Watching you shifting through your ups and downs, gives me the feeling, i know you better then your self do." sic.

![Beams ups and downs](../../content/tweets/beams-ups-and-downs.png){width=65%}

- I know it's related and non-random, just like the other accounts that have interacted with me previously.
- I look up "beams" in Spanish. It is "Vigas". I'm nearly sure that's the trumpet teacher's nickname because he has big legs.
- There are sinister references from this account too, suggestions of violence. The "impulses are waiting in line" sentence is very suggestive.
- Close to the end of our interaction he posts an extremely sinister picture.

![Beams clown](../../content/tweets/beams-clown.png){width=65%}

- This is a good example of the pattern of content coming from various anonymous accounts that interact with me, which I know are related to the trumpet teacher and Domingo; subtle threats of violence, subtle mentions of knowledge we share, trigger words and symbols, content peppered with romance and kindness, normal communication apparently, then a shock of some sort like the clown pic.
- I remain extraordinarily highly sexually aroused during this month.

!!! danger
    - Whatever is going on is showing no signs of stopping, even though I have been terrorized sufficiently to stop my studies at the conservatory.

## Madrid

- I head to Madrid from the 5th to the 11th of May. I'm flying out of Madrid on the 11th May to Bali for an event with work.
- Outside the hotel, I see strange guys hanging around and I always have the sense I'm being followed.
- Inside the hotel, online, I am stalked continuously and I believe they get full access again to my new Spanish mobile at this time.
- Around this time, I receive notification that the conservatory has banned mobiles from the building and I inform my friend about this.

### Novel events

- A significant event from this time will go in the novel.

## My speech

- On Saturday 11th May, I give a speech at the Let Women Speak event in Madrid: https://youtu.be/l9X6o11IwBc?t=1988.
- My speech describes being targeted by a "manada" (which mean "rape gang" in Spanish) in Denia and how it parallels precisely the child sexual abuse from when I was 16.

### The Spanish feminists tell me why they didn't support me

- At the event, and in the meetings prior, I meet Spanish feminists.
- They know me from the [previous September when I went public on Twitter](../2023/september.md#going-public-on-twitter).
- One of the organizers explains that, yes, we heard about someone from Denia conservatory, but it wasn't you.
- I tell her, yes it was me. I was asking for help for the same things I'm talking about today.
- No, no, it couldn't be you. We heard this woman was unstable, like a victim of domestic violence.
- I was flabbergasted.

## Telegram/Signal

- I believe they started to drug me seriously again at home since getting back to Denia in April.
- A Telegram chat on my Spanish phone invited me to play a game which I downloaded, probably how they so easily got access again, and it was just endless boredom.
- Then, in May, I was contacted on Twitter by an Elon Musk's brother fake account, who told me Elon wanted to talk to me, and gave me the Signal details.
- Weirdly, I go for it immediately.
- One of the first things this account says is "send pics". I am angry, and tell them I'm not interested in pics, and I don't want to see any male genitals, but I still continue to talk.
- It's not clear why although something in my mind believes it is the trumpet teacher again. It's very strange.
- It was extremely weird in fact. I had an extraordinarily long rant to this person's account while I was flying to Bali in May.
- In it, I mentioned one image seen on `@jctot19` Google search throughout December which was a film directed by

- They had hacked my newish phone again while I was in my hotel room.
- It was like the trumpet teacher was in my mind.
- I was completely out of my mind.
- They must have managed to drug me somehow during this time. I was out of my mind.

## Perito

- I leave for Lourdes at the end of the month.
