## Climbing the Montgo

- I climb the Montgo one Saturday afternoon.
- Close to the top, I "bump" into Ana. She is with a husky dog and a short, slightly built man.
- I realize it was him in the [blue car incident](../2023/november.md#ana-in-the-blue-van) ducking down.
- She says hello in an angry way. I find it utterly ironic and wonder if all Spanish people are psychopaths.
