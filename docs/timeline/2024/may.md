## Hazel Smith on Twitter

- This account was likely Hazel, or her mum, as we had a long chat: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1785410648802734485.
- The English on many of the stalker accounts was native. It could have been anyone in the region I suppose, except this account knew things that only myself and Hazel (or people who know her intimately) would know.
- The account profile pic is the face of my chamber music teacher that year, Esteve, which means that Hazel must be connected to Domingo in some way.
- Esteve was a genuinely nice man in my opinion.

![Hazel](../../content/images/threats/hazel/choral-symphony-thread-2.png)

- More recently (27th November), another account has popped-up as significant, Granny Smith. 
- This account has been targeting people close to me who thought they met them in person, but in the end we discovered they never had.

![Granny Smith](../../content/images/fake-accounts/lard-shugga.png)

- Except, the person who told me that was one of my dodgy [election volunteers](june.md#election-campaign), So or Janet who eventually appeared to be tag teaming online with the Smiths *and* the Denia porn-gangs.
- This account was deleted over the last two days. The timing on that is interesting.

## Targeting kids

- Online games.
- Cartoons.

## The laundry

- I go to the laundry to dry my clothes.
- A man comes in who recognizes me. I have no idea who he is.
- I email my mother and tell her.

![](../../content/images/laundry-man.png)

## Cars beeping outside

- Every day, in the morning and around lunchtime, a couple of cars will drive by and beep their horns when they're level with my apartment.
- One of the cars looks like the same car as was [lingering outside my flats in January](january.md#threatening-men-outside).
- One of the cars was a grey Mercedes coupe, or similar, sporty.

## Climbing the Montgo

- I climb the Montgo one Saturday afternoon.
- Close to the top, I "bump" into Ana Requena, the violin teacher. She is with a husky dog and a short, slightly built man.
- I realize it was this man in the [blue car incident](../2023/november.md#ana-in-the-blue-van), ducking down so he wouldn't be seen.
- I also remember him from meeting [Paul and Alessandra back in September 2023](../2023/september.md#alex-and-paul) in a cafe as one of the people who suddenly sat down beside us.
- She says hello in an angry way. 
- I find it utterly ironic and wonder if all Spanish people are psychopaths.
- Or was Ana now concerned she might be implicated in an actual murder and she was trying to cover her tracks in a confused way?

## Beams

- An account has been interact with my @JackChardwood account in an usual way: https://x.com/search?q=%20(to%3Ajackchardwood)(from%3Abeams_game)&src=typed_query&f=live
- The interaction runs from 26th April to 31st May.
- The account's name is `@Beams_Game`.

![Beams](../../content/images/beams-games.png)

- There is some tweetage and we DM too.
- He talks candidly about his extremely violent father. Much of this content is deleted now.
- On 8th May he posts "Watching you shifting through your ups and downs, gives me the feeling, i know you better then your self do." sic.

![Beams ups and downs](../../content/tweets/beams-ups-and-downs.png)

- He originally liked all my replies.
- I know it's related and non-random, just like the other accounts that have interacted with me previously.
- I look up "beams" in Spanish. It is "Vigas". I'm nearly sure that's the trumpet teacher's nickname because he has big legs.
- There are sinister references from this account too, suggestions of violence. The "impulses are waiting in line" sentence is very suggestive.
- Close to the end of our interaction he posts an extremely sinister picture.

![Beams clown](../../content/tweets/beams-clown.png)

- This is a good example of the pattern of content coming from the various anonymous accounts that have interacted with me, which I know are related to the trumpet teacher and Domingo:
    - Subtle threats of violence.
    - Subtle mentions of knowledge we share.
    - Trigger words and symbols, memes.
    - Content peppered with romance and kindness, normal communication apparently, then a shock of some sort like the clown pic.
- I remain extraordinarily highly sexually aroused during this month.

!!! danger
    - Whatever is going on is showing no signs of stopping, even though I have been terrorized sufficiently to stop my studies at the conservatory.

## Dreaming of the pedophile

- I dream of Winston M.
- I don't think I have ever dreamed of Winston M, apart from a few months after the [child sex attacks occurred in 1989](../early-years/2015.md#statement-to-the-metropolitan-police). 
- At that time, I dreamed he and I were in the same house in Plevna Crescent, and I asked him if I could go to the toilet, like a child asks an adult, and when I went to the toilet in the dream, I wet the bed in real life.
- I think this was a memory of something that had happened just after an extraordinarily traumatic event.
- I hadn't wet the bed since I was very small.
- In my dream in May 2024, he is wearing a yellow and grey checked jumper and a white chimney-sweep hat.
- We are in a kind of makeshift wooden room, like an external annex or temporary building.
- There are fold up tables with people sitting at them. There are piles of papers on the tables, leaflets maybe.
- He looks at me.
- I walk over to him to talk to him.
- He turns his head away and doesn't speak.

## Madrid

- I head to Madrid and stay from the 5th to the 11th of May. 
- I'm flying out of Madrid on the 11th May to Bali for an event with work and need to get away from Dénia as it is stressful being there.
- Outside my hotel in Madrid, I see strange guys hanging around and I always have the sense I'm being followed.
- Words from random conversations I have are posted on fake account profiles.
- Inside the hotel, online, I am stalked continuously and I believe they get full access again to my new Spanish mobile at this time.
- I have forgotten to block the camera and there is a significant message that describes something in the room or something I'm wearing
- On May 6th, I receive [an email notification that the conservatory has banned mobiles from the building](../../content/documents/emails/prohibiting-mobiles-conservatorio.pdf) and I inform my friend about this.
- I wonder if it is so no-one can take images or films for evidence of wrong doing.
- I have the sensation when I'm praying the rosary that [the monster trumpet teacher](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#dark-thick-curly-haired-deep-set-man) is standing with me and praying the rosary too. I cannot explain this.
- I am extremely sexually aroused during this time. And it felt like the trumpet teacher was in my mind.
- They must have managed to drug me somehow during this time. 
- I was out of my mind on the run up to the Bali Polygon conference.

## My speech

- On Saturday 11th May, I give a speech at the Let women Speak event in Madrid: https://youtu.be/l9X6o11IwBc?t=1988.
- My speech describes being targeted by a "manada" (which is vernacular for "rape gang" in Spanish) in Dénia and how it parallels precisely the child sexual abuse by a North London grooming gang I experienced when I was 16.
- I make the point that, I would be trans had I been born 30 years later and experienced the same thing.

### The Spanish feminists tell me why they didn't support me

- At the event, and in the online meetings prior, I meet Spanish feminists.
- They realize they know me from the [previous September when I went public on Twitter](../2023/september.md#going-public-on-twitter).
- One of the organizers explains that, yes, we heard about someone from Dénia conservatory, but it wasn't you.
- I tell her, yes it was me. I was asking for help for the same things I'm talking about today.
- "No, no, it couldn't be you. We heard this woman was unstable", she says, "like a victim of domestic violence".
- I remain flabbergasted.
- A woman interrogates me about what happened at lunch but my Spanish is so poor I can barely describe it.
- What I don't know is that I'm being drugged so I'm not at all clear about what's going on, and when I think about the trumpet teacher I get giggly because of the triggered sexual arousal.
- Later, in January 2025, someone posts me a picture of the woman who was organizing the Spanish feminists at this event as the face in the Sphinx.
- I take this to mean the woman has gitano connections and was told to discredit me whatever way she could; and she could not refuse the request.

## Telegram/Signal

- I believe the hackers/stalkers had started to drug me seriously again at home since getting back to Dénia in April.
- A Telegram chat on my Spanish phone invited me to play a game which I downloaded, probably how they so easily got access again, and it was just endless boredom.

!!! danger
    - I wonder now if this is how they target children.
    - Get them hooked into a game and then communicate online with them, hack their webcams like mine was, and manipulate them into something pedophilic. 

- Then, in May, I was contacted on Twitter by an Elon Musk's brother, a fake account obviously, who told me Elon wanted to talk to me, and gave me the Signal details.
- Weirdly, I'm hooked.
- One of the first things this account says is "send pics". 
- I am angry, and tell them I'm not interested in pics, and I don't want to see any male genitals, but I still continue to talk.
- It's not clear why although something in my mind believes it is the trumpet teacher again. It's very strange.
- It was extremely weird in fact. I sent an extraordinarily long rant to this person's account while I was flying to Bali in May.
- In it, I mentioned one image seen on `@jctot19` Google search throughout December which was a film directed by Mel Gibson about child sex trafficking, a true story: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7599146/.
- The film is playing on Turkish Airlines at the time and I watch it.
- It is a true story and the protagonist's wife is called Katharine.
- It's all so "meaningful".
- I wonder why they would have put that in Google search results for me to see, and I think the worst.

!!! info
    - Was the trumpet teacher alerting me to child sex trafficking going on in Dénia, with the conservatory somehow the training or recruitment ground?
    - It seemed preposterous to me.
    - More likely, they were referring to my child sexual abuse experience of grooming and trafficking that they had known about ever since I [reported it to the Metropolitan police](../early-years/2015.md#statement-to-the-metropolitan-police) and had become obsessed by it for some reason.

## Perito - technical expert DPR

- There are a bunch of emails over this time with the [perito in Alicante](../../content/documents/evidence/comms-with-perito.pdf).
- I collect my equipment and pay 150 eur on 23rd May.
- I receive an invoice document at that time.

    - [Invoice and receipt first page and payment](../../content/documents/evidence/DPR-1.JPG).
    - [Invoice and receipt second page](../../content/documents/evidence/DPR-2.JPG).

## Bali

- I am in Bali from 11th-19th May with work.
- My hotel room is next to John Michael from IT support. I reported my concerns about hacking to him previously.
- I notice constant "set up" events, just like in Denia, which mean someone is tracking mine, and other's, movements in order to create "chance" meetings.
- I seem to have "bumping into" episodes every day; *meaningfully* set up events and situations, or literally bumping into people meaningfully.
- The first one of these "chance meetings" is with Gabriel Silva on the first morning as I'm leaving my room.
- Did something happen the night before in my room?
- The second one is with Alicia a little later.
- Then the writer I worked with Jaime, Alicia again a few times, the Head of IT ... perhaps some of these were random. I hope so.
- During the week, numerous people come up to me to ask me, "when am I leaving?", or "I heard you're leaving".

![Bali](../../content/images/bali.png)

- It's clearly very easy to whip up bullies into a frenzy.
- I wonder what they might think if they knew they were supporting a mass-pedophile baby-rape network, amongst other things, in Denia.
- I guess they were probably excited and delighted about the sedated *switcheroo* porn; at least the men would have been.
- I complain to my manager, Paul O'Leary about it - the American CTO who replaced David Z. - referencing an earlier complaint I had made to him.
- Gabriel Silva, nothing to do with the writing team at that point, mentions how he is going to be sorting out the docs (my work) using other people who are not on the writing team. 
- It's a military coup; and that's *exactly* how I describe it to my manager Paul.
- When I speak to Paul O'Leary about this in Bali, he sort of [groans with familiarity](october.md#madrid-and-paloma), in exactly the same way Spanish government official Paloma groans when I tell her about the porn-gangs and pedophilia going on at the conservatory of Denia.
- The bullying continues over the following month where another employee, on Gabriel's orders, tries to pretend my systems are unusable, but he can't really and he just looks stupid. It's all in the Git records.
- The implication, however, is that I am incompetent. And mud sticks.
- This has been Gabriel's outward view of me since January after hearing from Grace Torrellas about my women's rights activities, and why, I assume, he stopped giving me any work at that time.
- However, there is something much more sinister going on at Polygon.
- Polygon Spanish male founders and developers know exactly what is going on for me in Denia, and are involved in the conspiracy; at least from [12th June 2023](../2023/june.md#monday-12th-june-2023) when whatever was supposed to happen didn't, but possibly before.
- I believe this is why I was [re-programmed into feeling extraordinarily sexually aroused by the gypsies](april.md#the-trumpet-teacher-in-denia) just before traveling to Bali.
- I remain high and euphoric and extraordinarily sexually aroused throughout May, and especially in Bali.
- Is my hotel room set up with spy-cams?
- I write an extraordinarily long message to a hacker I believe is the trumpet teacher on Signal while I'm on the plane.
- Curiously, the film I watch on the plane is [The Sound of Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_of_Freedom_(film)); a true story about child sex trafficking, and more curiously the film's picture came up as a result on my `@jctot19 x` searches around December 2023.
- I find the whole thing very significant, obviously, and I am 100% convinced the person I'm talking to on Signal is the trumpet teacher.
- Bullying just got worse and worse for me after Bali with the intention, I believe, of me leaving, which I didn't.
- The reason there are nearly 3000 issues in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-docs/issues) is because my job was hacked by my colleagues around the time they had had enough of whatever they were doing with me and were ready to get rid of me. Did they know I was about to be murdered?

### The security guy knows something

- Gordon Bishop is the man on the security team who helped me with my [hacked work laptop](march/1-12.md#reporting-hacking-to-polygon-labs).
- He meets me before a dinner one evening.
- He is nervous.
- He wants to tell me something but he can't.
- He talks at me, very fast, a lot, and doesn't let me speak.
- He's concerned.
- He knows something about what's going on.
- I have had long chats with Gordon before and this is not like him.
- I know he's a family man.

### The Pakistani Yorkshire-man

- On the first morning of sessions, I'm stressed and anxious as people have been making sly comments to me continuously.
- Maybe something happened to me the night before in my hotel room too. It's not clear. I'm overly anxious and there's not really a good reason for the level of stress I'm feeling.
- At the end of the morning session, someone comes over to talk to me.
- He says concerning things in a sinister way, like oh I hear you're leaving, and some other unpleasant stuff. He is the fat man with the mushroom hat on his profile pics. I can't remember his name just now, but he was pals with Jaime, and part of a concerted bullying attack in March with Alicia and her team.
- He's waiting for everyone to leave. Once they're gone, and I'm reasonably more upset than I already was, he walks away down the aisle, giving an Indian man on the other side the nod as he goes by.
- I see the Indian-looking fellow grinning at me at that moment.
- He walks over. No-one else is around.
- There is a handful of people at the back of the conference hall.
- Are they watching?
- The man has long black hair and enormous grinning white teeth. 
- He looks like, and reminds me of, [Jitendra Das](../early-years/2010.md#why-i-decided-to-be-celibate-for-the-rest-of-my-life). No exaggeration. 
- In July 2025, I wonder whether he was supposed to look like Jitendra Das!
- He tells me he's Pakistani, from Rochdale, Yorkshire; rape-gang territory.
- His Oxford-English accent says otherwise.
- He grins at me constantly.
- At dinner, he makes violent sexual threats towards me.

![Pakistani threats at dinner](../../content/images/pakistani-man-threatens-woman.png)

- I tweet about it and tell Spanish HR the following morning.

[![Sexual violence at dinner](../../content/images/sexual-violence-at-dinner.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1790392972057747804)
- I tweet about it.

[![Sexual violence threats at dinner](../../content/images/sexual-violence-at-dinner.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1790392972057747804)

- While this guy, Aziv Abad (maybe his name, probably not), a Rust engineer who had started the job that week was talking to us, his chatter was so disordered he reminded me of [Nadim Kobesi](../2023/november.md#polygon).
- Was this sexually threatening man another actor, just like Nadim was?
- Were they both hired to terrorize me, and for no other reason?
- I remember saying to Anthony that night that the man had Nadim energy.
- He behaved extremely strangely and menacingly towards me.
- I wonder who he really is, and how much Polygon management paid him, and if I'm on some sort of destroy-the-woman porn soap-opera somewhere?
- It seems more and more likely doesn't it. 
- Do they do the same to the kids now?

### Alicia

- Alicia Katz worked at Polygon and was part of the bullying I described to my manager (the CTO at the time that took over from David Schwartz) as a military coup operation.
- At Bali, I was set up to "bump" into her a couple of times. 
- I assume engineers at Polygon had the same sort of pinpoint location access to my physical whereabouts as did teachers and staff at the conservatory of Denia, and local townsfolk and porn-gang members.
- I'm pretty sure, like most people at Polygon and elsewhere, she was persuaded to go along with bullying me because of my women's rights activities and concerns about child safeguarding. It's a common thing, whatever.
- She wouldn't have known about the spy-cam and sedating porn going on at my apartment in Denia at the time. I didn't know myself.
- Anyway, shortly after Bali, Alicia leaves the firm suddenly. 
- In her leaving note, she mentions "the worst thing in the world happened" at Bali and how Sandeep Naiwal had really helped her out by getting her a new job.
- I wonder what "the worst thing in the world" was and if it was sexual in content.
- I have reached out to Alicia in case what happened to her at Bali is relevant to this story and to the global tech-bro porn conspiracy overall.

### John Michael

- When we get back from Bali, a few days later there is a chat on Slack about John Michael.
- Someone has nominated him for being the best tech employee ever and Bali is mentioned.
- I agree. 
- John Michael is indeed a lovely man.
- Are they laughing at me?

### Anthony

- You don't have to die: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-Have-Anthony-Mpho-Matlala-ebook/dp/B00H2JPKRK/.
- Very curious, a good choker-seed for when my life is truly threatened after I'm caught up in some honey-trap relationship, probably with [number 3 trumpet teacher](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#an-unknown-man-i-may-have-a-picture-of)?
- Or something closer to the divine?

### Hans

- Dinner with Hans.
- Oh they're really gonna go for you, he says.
- Keeping look out.

### Chess with the Head of IT

- I play chess at dinner with the Head of IT.
- This is the first time I notice my chess playing is appalling; I'm rubbish, below average.
- This is not like me at all.
- At the time, I just put it down to a *one off* scenario.
- In September, when I join Chess.com, I find out that my cognitive left-brain skills required to be a good chess player are all but disappeared.

### Eye troubles

- I meet people, or they are pointed out to me, but I'm struggling to remember them when I meet them again.
- It's like everyone's face is a bit blurry and the same.
- The founder Sandeep is annoyed that I don't know who he is, and I met him only the day before.
- The following day I do not recognize him again.
- Everyone talks to me like I'm the antichrist, and any tiny defect is proof of it, this included.

### Investigatory suggestions

- I would check with the conference team what special requirements were made for certain people's rooms, such as mine and JTs, and Alicia's.

## Lourdes

- I leave for Lourdes at the end of the month.
- I plan to spend two weeks in Lourdes.
- I need to be out of Dénia as much as possible.
- It's enormously stressful being there as anytime I leave my house, shopping, going to the laundry, walking to the beach, I am harassed and followed by locals.
- It's clear to me, however, that no matter where I am, the cyber stalking will continue.
