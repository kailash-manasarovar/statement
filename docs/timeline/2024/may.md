## Cars beeping outside

- Outside my flat
- Same car as [february](january.md#threatening-men-outside)

## Climbing the Montgo

- I climb the Montgo one Saturday afternoon.
- Close to the top, I "bump" into Ana. She is with a husky dog and a short, slightly built man.
- I realize it was him in the [blue car incident](../2023/november.md#ana-in-the-blue-van) ducking down.
- She says hello in an angry way. I find it utterly ironic and wonder if all Spanish people are psychopaths.

## The trumpet teacher in Denia

- Either the 5th of the 12th of May, a Sunday, I go to the Chinese restaurant.
- As I'm walking back home, I pass by a group of gypsies.

## Beams

- An account has been interact with my @JackChardwood account in an usual way: https://x.com/search?q=%20(to%3Ajackchardwood)(from%3Abeams_game)&src=typed_query&f=live
- The interaction is from 26th April to 31st May.
- The account's name is `@Beams_Game`.

- There is some tweetage and we DM too.
- He talks about his violent father. Much of this content is deleted now.
- On 8th May he posts "Watching you shifting through your ups and downs, gives me the feeling, i know you better then your self do." sic.

- I know it's related and non-random, just like the other accounts that have interacted with me previously.
- I look up "beams" in Spanish. It is "Vigas". I'm nearly sure that's the trumpet teacher's nickname because he has big legs.
- There are sinister references from this account too, suggestions of violence. The "impulses are waiting in line" sentence is very suggestive.
- Close to the end of our interaction he posts an extremely sinister picture.

- This is a good example of the pattern of content coming from various anonymous accounts that interact with me, which I know are related to the trumpet teacher and Domingo; subtle threats of violence, subtle mentions of knowledge we share, trigger words and symbols, content peppered with romance and kindness, normal communication apparently, then a shock of some sort like the clown pic.
- I remain extraordinarily highly sexually aroused during this month.

    - Whatever is going on is showing no signs of stopping, even though I have been terrorized sufficiently to stop my studies at the conservatory.
