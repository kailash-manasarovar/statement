## Jyotirlinga trip to India

- I leave Spain on 29th March and spend the first week of April on a tour in India with a friend.
- I stay at a posh hotel near the airport in Mumbai for a couple of days by myself in safety.
- I feel like I'm getting pneumonia I'm coughing so much.
- I crack the same rib [I cracked at yoga class](march/1-12.md#cracked-rib) from coughing in my hotel room.
- I'm coughing up blood now.
- I call the hotel doctor. He prescribes serious antibiotics and pleurisy medicine and says to call him in a day to let him know how I'm doing.
- I manage to [write to the Guardia Civil](march/13-end.md#letter-to-the-guardia-civil) and send the letter registered from the hotel.
- I'm meeting my friend Yan from Singapore.
- We are going to visit the five jyotirlinga temples in Maharashtra with a driver.
- I invite Yan for breakfast the day before we take the tour. I tell him what's been happening to me, what I know. I'm coughing so hard I can hardly speak.
- Later that evening, feeling a little better, I contact my mother directly from a mock email I've created on my phone.
- I send her a picture.

![Me in Mumbai](../../content/images/me-in-mumbai.jpg)

- This is the first time she has seen me in three-and-a-half years.
- I use the name of my mock email on my X profile for a short while.

![DCI Lydia Cleaves](../../content/images/lydia-cleaves-x-profile.jpg)

- Hackers have been more recently bombarding me with references to Elon Musk, hence the location reference.

### Bring him to Me

- I can't stop thinking about the trumpet teacher. 
- I think about him every thirty seconds or so. It's never ending, and inexplicable. 
- I deal with it as best I can.
- In retrospect, I'm definitely high on something. 
- That, coupled with the elevated divine energy on our tour may explain the following experience I had at Bhimashankar.
- Nandi, the little bull that Shiva uses for transport, always sits outside the Shiva temple looking in.
- They say if you whisper your wishes in Nandi's ear, he will grant them.
- At the first jyotirlinga temple we visit, [Bhimashankar](https://www.bhimashankar.in/), I whisper in Nandi's ear my wishes concerning the trumpet teacher.

![Bring him to Me](../../content/images/whispering-in-nandis-ear.png)

- In the queue I have been preparing what I want to ask for, the sentence is ready, but when I go to whisper my waffly request into Nandi's ear, something takes over.
- My whispered wish becomes a bold statement: *Bring him to me!*.
- And, at *exactly* the same time, matching every word of mine, I hear a booming voice coming from inside the temple saying, "Bring him to Me!".
- I have no non-God explanation for this - apart from the mandrake that I must have been ingesting unawares from my toiletries, and that's also a God-explanation depending on who you talk to.

## Lunch with Christine

- I return to Spain.
- Christine BJ arranges a hurried lunch. 
- She wants to know about my friend Yan, the man I traveled with in India.
- Who he is, how I know him, how old he is, what he does for a living, where he lives, what his parents do, and repeat.
- She asks me these questions over and over.
- I think it bizarre, and I'm perplexed that a random man in my life is way more interesting to her than the hell I'm enduring at home in Dénia.
- Was she sent to gather urgent intel on Yan and report back?
- Was it because I have a friend who the criminal gangs were previously unaware of?
- Did they do a bit of research on him and find something out something that caused them anxiety?
- Of course, the most worrying thing for a brave and bold criminal gang terrorizing a single woman living alone is if she is not, after all, alone. 
- Little did they know... although I did keep telling them.
- The inherent cowardice is off the scale.
- Whenever I get a chance to change the subject I explain to Christine what's been happening to me at the hands of Dénia criminals.
- Chris BJ maneuvers the conversation back into generalities.
- We speak about bullying.
- She tells me she was a bully at boarding school.
- I express the sane and world-saving idea that it is far better to be bullied than to be a bully.
- *Who in their right mind would want to be a bully?*, I announce with some passion.
- Her face flashes surprise.

## Dodgy lorry, van, and car registrations

- I had been noticing some odd-looking vans and cars outside Carrer Furs for quite some time, probably since early 2023.
- It didn't seem to be anything I had to be concerned with until September 2023, at which time I started to write down registration numbers whenever I had the wit to remember to do so.
- I remember a very weird van with blacked-out windows and a big aerial, maybe even a satellite dish, parked right below my window every day.
- There were also similarly bizarre looking vans along the back road too.
- Given I live in a seaside town, and the beach is at the bottom of the road, I just assumed that these vehicles belonged to regular people living in vans by the sea and having their own Internet access. Sounds rather nice although a bit cramped.
- When the multiple cars started to [beep outside my apartment every day in a threatening manner as they drove past](may.md#cars-beeping-outside), I began to more assiduously take registration numbers.
- I had them on notes in the apartment, which I misplaced eventually, and sometimes I added them to my phone.
- Here's a small list from April 2024 I found on the Android phone I bought in the [Chinese telecom store in Madrid](march/13-end.md#madrid).

![List of dodgy registrations](../../content/images/car-regs.jpg)

## Response from the Generalitat

- On my return, I receive a letter from the Generalitat dated the 2nd April 2024, and signed on 3rd April 2024.
- It is in response to my numerous complaints.
- They basically say they investigated and found nothing untoward going on.
- It's not clear what reports they requested, or from whom, or what's in them.
- The investigation they are referring to having done was the [inspector ambushing me at piano lesson on 5th March](march/1-12.md#an-inspector-calls) and bullying me even more for about five minutes.
- I'm not sure what they are referring to when they mention "former students". As far as I'm aware, I mentioned nothing about any former students.
- I did, in fact, state repeatedly I was concerned for the safety of *current* students as I have also stated in this police statement numerous times.

??? tip "Translation of the Generalitat's response into English"
    Alicante, April 2, 2024

    On October 22, 2023, she sent a letter to the Ministry of Education, in which she stated that she was being harassed by the teachers and staff of the Professional Conservatory of Music Mestre Tenor Cortis de Dénia, specifically indicating that she had suffered: harassment by gangs on social networks, cyberbullying, personal harassment by teachers and staff of the conservatory, damage to her personal property by teachers and staff; and harassment on the street by strangers. She also referred to Mr. Domingo Cano who was her piano teacher during the 14/15 academic year. Subsequently, she has sent different emails in which she exposes the same facts in which former students of the center would also be involved.

    The Education Inspectorate has carried out several actions in order to clarify the reported facts. Reports have been requested from the management team and an interview was held with the interested party herself, in which, among other things, she was informed that the Inspectorate had sent her a letter of reply dated 19/12/23, however, since the postal address she had provided was incomplete, it was returned by the postal service.

    Regarding the facts referred to, it should be noted that you have been enrolled in the Professional Conservatory of Music Tenor "Cortis" in the 2014/2015, 2015/2016. 2022/2023 and the current 2023/2024 years in the piano specialty, having received classes from about twelve different teachers and that you only received classes from Mr. Domingo Cano at the beginning of the 2014/15 school year, because the teacher was changed at your request.

    For all this, the investigations carried out show that there has been no evidence that any teacher has behaved inappropriately towards students at the centre and there are no complaints regarding any type of personal harassment or damage to their property, or towards any other student, in which conservatory staff may have participated. Likewise, the Inspectorate has not received any complaint from any parent or student on this issue.

    For all this, given that most of what you are referring to has occurred outside the scope of the conservatory, if you consider that there are facts that could constitute a criminal offense, you must contact the competent judicial authority to proceed with the corresponding complaint.

    In any case, the educational inspection will continuously monitor the activity of the center, advising the educational agents who are intervening in order to guarantee correct attention to the students and promote their well-being and academic development.

## Leak resumes

- One morning when I go to collect the car, I notice the [leak from the windscreen washing fluid tank](../2023/september.md#problem-with-my-car) has started again.
- I text Pedro the caretaker about it.

![Text Pedro about the leak](../../content/whatsapps/chat-about-the-leak-with%20pedro.jpg)

- Here's the downloaded [WhatsApp](../../content/whatsapps/April%202024/WhatsApp%20Chat%20with%20CONSERJE%20VILLAMAR.zip) chat.
- Eventually, we talk in person and I agree to Pedro's suggestion that his friend the mechanic comes to have a look at the problem.
- Pedro's friend comes to check my car the following day but can't find any problem.
- He tells me I will have to bring the car to the workshop.
- His workshop is quite far away in the industrial polygon.
- I don't want to leave my car with someone I don't know, and I don't know how I will travel there and back.
- Pedro, excited, tells me not to worry he will take me there and back himself, in his car.
- My body screams at me that it's a set up, maybe to get me alone with Pedro. Pedro is [a bit pervy](../2023/september.md#pedro-ogles-a-tourist), you see.
- I immediately say no and walk away.
- Pedro looks ashamed.
- After this, the leaks stops and/or is intermittent.
- In June when I'm in the UK, I take the car to Kwik Fit in London N12.
- They fix a broken motor in the window washer function of my car and tell me there's no leak at all.
- I believe Pedro, or others known to him, were able to access my car engine and cause what looked like a leak, but wasn't.
- I wondered if, by the same methods, criminals added some mind-altering substance that could come in through the air vents, or something I could touch on the door handles, wheel, or gearstick maybe.
- Could this be what caused [overwhelming sexual arousal on Hanuman Jayanti in 2023](../2023/april.md#hanuman-jayanti)?
- I eventually told Pedro that I had been filmed sexually without my knowledge, and that I would pay 500 euros for any recordings.
- He was fired very soon after that and replaced by an unusually surly man.
- Pedro [sends me a text at Christmas](december.md#pedro-sends-a-christmas-greeting).
- He tells me is just back from visiting a family at Carrer Furs.
- Did they hire him back once they were done with me?

!!! danger "Connections"
    - Reading this back reminds me that one of the targeted women the criminals sent multiple pictures of ended up in a car garage somewhere, clearly sedated, in increasing states of undress in the front seat and the back seat of a [grey sports car](september.md#another-upsetting-targeted-woman).
    - In one of the photos, you can see a small Hispanic man crouching down in the foot of the drivers side of the car, giving a sense of many people being around while these photos were taken.

## Resigning from the conservatory

- I send resignation letters to Paqui via email on Monday 8th April.
- I explain to her how I am genuinely afraid for my life, and how whatever is happening concerns Lorraine Blackbourn's untimely death.

    Portal 1, ESC2, Piso 3, Apt 17</br>
    Denia</br>
    03700 Alicante</br>
    Monday 8th April 2024</br>
    </br>
    To whom it may concern,</br>
    </br>
    After a two-year campaign of gender violence in the form of bullying, aggression, and 
    psychological intimidation by teachers and staff at the Tenor Cortis conservatory in Denia, I now have sufficient fear for my personal safety that I will no longer be coming to classes.</br>
    </br>
    The latest flurry of violent imagery and messages on Twitter, and the psychological bullying at the piano concert on Tuesday 12th March - in which a woman dressed up to look exactly like a friend, Lorraine Blackbourn, who tragically committed suicide in Denia after gender-based bullying and intimidation - I consider to signify a genuine threat to my life.</br>
    </br>
    I previously understood the bullying to come from a small number of teachers and staff, and their families/friends on the streets of Denia, as I mentioned many times in my private letters of complaint I wrote to the Generalitat. As you know, these letters were ignored completely. I 
    received no reply at all. They were, instead, shared with teachers and staff at the conservatory.</br>
    </br>
    Sharing these letters was obviously going to put me in even more danger at the school, online, 
    and in the streets of Denia.</br>
    </br>
    I believe there are also private and stolen photos, recordings, and videos of me; hacked with the sole intention of shaming and silencing me, perhaps blackmailing too, and it concerns me that other students, especially young women and children, may be suffering in the same way. I have informed numerous authorities about this.</br>
    </br>
    I now realize, albeit belatedly, that literally everyone at the school, teachers, staff, and students, and even the Generalitat itself - whether intentionally or because they are too scared to do otherwise - are firmly in support of me having to leave the school due to gender violence.</br>
    </br>
    It is very shocking to me that a public institution funded by taxpayers could so easily treat a 
    student in this way. And it is not a unique event.</br>
    </br>
    It remains to be said that at the conservatory in Denia, with the support of the Generalitat, there appears to be zero concern for the safety and wellbeing of students at the school who complain about inappropriate behavior from teachers and staff.</br>
    </br>
    As I mentioned many times, the campaign of terror relates to me refusing a piano teacher who 
    had sought a romantic relationship with me 10 years ago.</br>
    </br>
    There is also some suggestion that the collective hatred towards me has been further incited with reference to my political views on Twitter.</br>
    </br>
    I myself have only ever wanted to play the piano in peace.</br>
    </br>
    With the very best,</br>
    Dra Katharine Murphy

### Paqui's response

- Paqui responds via email on Tuesday 9th April.

![Paqui's response](../../content/documents/emails/paquis-response-to-my-resignation-letter.jpg)

??? info "Translation of Paqui's response"
    Hello Katharine

    I'm sorry to read the letter you sent me.

    First of all, I want you to know that no private letters have been shared; in fact, I haven't seen them either. However, I am aware that the letters haven't been ignored.

    We went to the police this morning to explain your situation. You need to report this to law enforcement, providing some kind of proof to verify your statement, so they can investigate.

    I am available for anything you need

    Paqui Fornet

- I respond, asking her to confirm what they went to the police about.

![Asking what they went to the police about](../../content/documents/emails/ask-to-know-what-she-went-to-the-police-about.jpg)

- She ignores my email. 
- I never knowingly hear from her again.
- Here's the [full resignation email thread with Paqui](../../content/documents/emails/Full-resignation-email-thread.pdf).
- I carbon-copy the UK embassy and the Irish embassy into the email in case I'm arrested by the police.
- The mention of the police, together with the [suggestion from the Generalitat's inspector that she was going to report *me* to the police](march/1-12.md#an-inspector-calls), and my friend in Madrid's suggestion I could be arrested for defamation, triggers another strong PTSD reaction.
- I become convinced, yet again, I'm going to be arrested for some undisclosed matter.
- I believe this belief was being heavily reinforced by online manipulation during this period.
- I believe this is an irrational terror that was first triggered in my mind in 1989 by the Tottenham rape gangs, and how they very effectively silence children who have some respect for law enforcement.
- You could ask Winston May or Colin Day about that, I guess.
- Certainly, the Generalitat and Paqui Fornet also, somehow, seemed to be aware that this was an effective manner of frightening and silencing me.

### Paqui account

- Fake accounts with a (what I find at this moment to be an even more) threatening picture of Paqui appear again on my X account notifications.

![Paqui](../../content/images/fake-accounts/paqui1.png)

- I believe they posted these pics of Paqui to *ensure* I didn't think about returning to the conservatory.
- This is a screenshot from the end of March of one of the other accounts that had her picture: https://x.com/Zingley2. 

![Paqui on 28th March](../../content/images/threats/paqui2-zingley.png)

- The picture of Paqui continues to appear on Google search results.
- There was a bunch of accounts like this at the time, and I see them pop up once again in September 2024, perhaps to ensure I didn't try and return to my studies again!
- No, by that time, I had been safely handed-over by the conservatory to the porn-gangs for their pleasure and Ferrari payments.

## The third time I'm convinced I'm going to be arrested

- I believe I'm going to be arrested at any moment.

</audio>

- It's interesting I state it as a *feeling*.
- It was a very strong fearfulness, actually.
- Given the outrageous behavior of teachers and staff at the conservatory, and the total disinterest of the police, and the seriousness of what's happening to me, I'm quite sure that anything is possible.
- I'm convinced that online triggering from hackers and online-stalkers was exacerbating this feeling.
- I search for a lawyer and send an email to a number of lawyers in the region asking for help.

![Email asking for help](../../content/documents/emails/worried-the-conservatory-will-accuse-me-of-defamation.png)

- I also call the British Foreign Office in Spain and speak to a lady called Lisa.
- I attach the videos and transcripts of the call below. 
- I'm obviously extremely stressed and scared. 

    - [Video of me speaking with the British Foreign Office - part 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PbJYX7DG0pjAPE3Jh7OoyW5k9urXcDZE/view?usp=sharing) and [transcript](../../content/vids/scared%20and%20stressed%201_transcript.txt).
    - [Video of me speaking with the British Foreign Office - part 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kT-BFILgBWnVTBALHepboNzpGCxBoi4f/view?usp=drive_link) and [transcript](../../content/vids/scared%20and%20stressed%202_transcript.txt).

- The British FO weren't able to help me at that time.
- In response to an email I sent to https://carbrayinternational.com/, I receive a notification that my message was blocked by the server. 
- All the other lawyers, apart from a couple of them, say they cannot help me, or don't have someone who can deal with me in English.
- Eventually, I find a lawyer who can help me if I'm arrested who speaks English and is registered with a British legal authority; [Roberto Rodriguez](#roberto-rodriguez-lawyer) based in Alicante.
- He also says he can also help me with any translating I need done with the cyber-expert.
- I believe now that I may have been shepherded towards this person online, as usual.

![Roberto the lawyer](../../content/whatsapps/roberto-laywer.jpg)

- Here's the [initial email conversation](../../content/documents/emails/roberto-rodriguez-email.pdf) I had with Roberto.
- From this point forward, he called me or we communicated on WhatsApp.

## Online searches for Vidal Sastre

- I periodically search online for references for "Vidal Sastre Sanchez Hornero".
- The results are often peculiar and seem curated, just for me.
- There are relatively few on the 15th April. However, I do note the name is listed on published Generalitat lists.

![Sastre on the GV lists](../../content/documents/evidence/sastre-gv.png)

- In October, a Spanish government official will tell my friend from Madrid to tell me there is no record of anyone with this name in the Generalitat systems, a lie.
- Someone, somewhere, with sufficient access to my devices was helping me with my investigation into what was going on.
- Could it have been [number one trumpet teacher](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#the-older-slimmer-greyer-man); a sole individual who saw exactly what the porn-addicted men of Spain have become, their self-made hellscape protected at the highest level, with seemingly nothing anyone can do about it?
- Was he an anomaly amongst men, unusually worried for his own children? 
- Am I the last hope for the dwindling sane in Spain?

## Final chat with Jorge Tuesday 16th

- I'm still vacillating on who I want to analyze my devices.
- I trust my friend in Madrid but I believe, from things she has told me, that she could also be hacked.
- I'm planning on visiting Alicante on Thursday and Friday of this week.
- I check in with Jorge.
- He is busy so I forget about him and decide to go with DPR, the company that [my friend helped me write to](march/13-end.md#cyber-expert).

## Roberto Rodriguez, lawyer

- I am communicating with Roberto Rodriguez about visiting Alicante this week.
- I need a lawyer to represent me at the police station with evidence of hacking before they will investigate the crimes against me, and that's why I have hired him.
- We have spoken on the phone multiple times.
- He asks me to send him the information about the expert I intend to visit.
- I WhatsApp him for the first time with the details of [DPR Recovery](https://dprrecovery.com/) on the evening of Thursday 18th April.
- We have agreed to meet at the DPR offices at 13:00 the following day and I confirm this with him.
- Roberto has been talking about another company he is keen I use instead called [Tecnofix](#tecnofix).
- He tells me to contact them.
- In one voice recording during our WhatsApp chat he tells me he is at the company and they are expecting my call: `PTT-20240418-WA0002.opus`.
- I guess he knows these guys personally.
- I have no recollection of communicating with this company although I do seem to have made a 9 minute call to them on 18th April.
- Whatever was said, as far as I know, I had no further communication with them that day and decided to continue with DPR.
- Curiously, I have a [somewhat concerning communication with them](#tecnofix) on 28th October 2024, the week that criminal gangs try to murder me in my own home by poisoning.
- Here's my WhatsApp communication with Roberto up to Thursday 18th, the night before I visit the cyber expert DPR.

    18/04/2024, 19:29 - Robert Rodriguez: Ok no idea of the company</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:29 - det sgt lydia cleaves: Because they noticed the router breach when I asked them to check it</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:29 - det sgt lydia cleaves: Their security team found evidence of a breach at the router about 4/6 weeks ago</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:29 - det sgt lydia cleaves: I had to stop working from home</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:30 - det sgt lydia cleaves: At the same time there was a very big psychological attack by the conservatory at the piano concert</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:30 - det sgt lydia cleaves: My webcam was accessed at that time and the day after</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:30 - det sgt lydia cleaves: That day and following day there was serious threatening activity in the street</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:31 - det sgt lydia cleaves: So I left for Madrid and lived in hotels for 2 weeks</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:31 - det sgt lydia cleaves: I didn't feel safe at all</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:31 - det sgt lydia cleaves: Men made scary "ghost" noises on the webcam</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:32 - det sgt lydia cleaves: It's related to a friend who committed suicide here 3 years ago who they were suggesting they did the same thing to and drove her to it, or worse</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:32 - det sgt lydia cleaves: That was my assessment of the threats, and I took it seriously, and still do</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:34 - Robert Rodriguez: Ok the most relevant thing of It all IS obviously the evidence . Use your phone to record weird things</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:34 - det sgt lydia cleaves: Yes I could have so many things but I haven't been recording anything</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:34 - det sgt lydia cleaves: I believe they will stop now because they know I am leaving</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:35 - det sgt lydia cleaves: And they have gone to the police about me... When I asked for details they didn't answer</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:35 - Robert Rodriguez: Thats a problem of course but if in the future It happens again...</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:35 - det sgt lydia cleaves: I think they will have denounced me falsely</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:36 - Robert Rodriguez: In what basis? Cant be a Big deal at all</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:36 - det sgt lydia cleaves: So I would like to defend this robustly if it comes to pass</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:36 - det sgt lydia cleaves: Defamation maybe</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:36 - det sgt lydia cleaves: Because I complained to the generalitat in private in letters about what was happening</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:37 - det sgt lydia cleaves: As it all relates to me turning down a piano teacher romantically 10 years ago</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:37 - det sgt lydia cleaves: And behaves extremely inappropriately with young girls</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:37 - det sgt lydia cleaves: And I voiced my concernd</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:37 - det sgt lydia cleaves: Concerns</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:37 - det sgt lydia cleaves: I did not accuse anyone of anything</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:38 - det sgt lydia cleaves: This man threatened me with violence at that time too</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:38 - det sgt lydia cleaves: They have been gang stalking me on twitter also</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:38 - Robert Rodriguez: PTT-20240418-WA0002.opus (file attached - he is at the Technofix shop now and tells me to call them)</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:38 - det sgt lydia cleaves: And I said a lot of things on twitter but no accusations</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:39 - det sgt lydia cleaves: Ok what's the number</br>

    18/04/2024, 19:40 - Robert Rodriguez: Call them now pls</br>
    18/04/2024, 19:49 - Robert Rodriguez: null (I call them)</br>
    18/04/2024, 20:19 - det sgt lydia cleaves: Just one other thing is that I believe (know actually) that they have extremely private videos and recordings of me, of a sexual nature, and i expect planned to blackmail me with them at some point but I would be happy if they became public because then there would be excellent evidence .</br>
    18/04/2024, 20:20 - det sgt lydia cleaves: My question is .. given that many many people here in Denia will have seen these, it cannot be too hard to find them, do you have any idea of how we could get copies, ie private detective services maybe??</br>
    18/04/2024, 20:41 - Robert Rodriguez: The Police should be able to do It better than anyone Kate</br>
    18/04/2024, 20:41 - det sgt lydia cleaves: But they want me to prove it exists to them first before they investigate! I know it exists</br>
    18/04/2024, 20:42 - det sgt lydia cleaves: It's very frustrating</br>
    18/04/2024, 20:42 - Robert Rodriguez: No, if you report It they should investigate it</br>
    18/04/2024, 20:42 - det sgt lydia cleaves: Ok</br>
    18/04/2024, 20:43 - Robert Rodriguez: This is why may be It IS better to use a lawyer, cos It sounds weird and they may think you are exagerating</br>
    18/04/2024, 20:43 - det sgt lydia cleaves: Exactly</br>
    18/04/2024, 20:43 - det sgt lydia cleaves: See you manyana</br>
    18/04/2024, 20:43 - Robert Rodriguez: Ok</br>
    18/04/2024, 22:16 - det sgt lydia cleaves: Remind me to tell you about the CCTV there probably is..</br>

- Later, I read online that a man [has been removed from political office in Toledo](https://www.timesnownews.com/world/europe/spanish-politician-daniel-gmez-del-barrio-resigns-after-photos-reveal-he-offered-himself-as-sex-slave-article-109256687) after spy-cam porn was released of him.
- I find this very similar to what's going on for me.
- Roberto texts me again, very late, with what sounds like a made up excuse and cancels our meeting and says he is unavailable all day.
- It's disappointing.
- He says I can call him for help translating instead.

- Who did he talk to?
- What did he find out that made him back off hurriedly?

### WhatsApp with Roberto the English-speaking lawyer

- Here's the rest of my communication on [WhatsApp with Roberto](../../content/whatsapps/WhatsApp%20Chat%20with%20Robert%20Rodriguez.zip) over the next months.
- He clearly doesn't want anything to do with me.
- One wonders what he found out and whether his Telegram pic suggests he knew *exactly* what was happening to me.

    03/06/2024, 00:59 - det sgt lydia cleaves: Roberto I want to take the Generalitat to court for knowingly putting students in danger. They made me fear for my life, and I can prove it. They terrorised me on twitter and elsewhere and I can prove it. I don't care if I win or lose, I want the media attention.</br>
    03/06/2024, 00:59 - det sgt lydia cleaves: Can you help?</br>

    03/06/2024, 01:03 - det sgt lydia cleaves: They will be very keen to avoid the publicity.</br>

    03/06/2024, 01:28 - Robert Rodriguez: Haha. Yes but I would not take a case if I consider that you have no prospectos if success as It would be unfair on you and on my ethics</br>
    03/06/2024, 01:29 - Robert Rodriguez: Ok if you can make a very brief resume and send me the best evidence that you have I Will check it</br>

    10/06/2024, 02:08 - Robert Rodriguez: Thanks a lot Kate 😀😀😀😍</br>

- Are all sedated rape and multiple porn-gang cases out of legal ethical jurisdiction because it is assumed, due to sky-high corruption, that they'll never succeed?
- Has Spain sacrificed its women and children to the porn-gangs that control the country?

### Tecnofix

- Roberto recommended I use [this company](https://www.tecnofixinformatica.com/) instead of DPR Recovery.
- I speak to them, and decide not to use them, and then I forget about them completely.
- Curiously, I made a call to them without meaning to from Dénia on 28th October 2024 at the same time [I was being seriously poisoned in my own home](october.md#serious-poisoning-with-intent-to-harm-or-kill).
- I think hackers took control of my phone at that moment and made this call.

![Tecnofix](../../content/whatsapps/technofix-1.jpg){width=50%}![](../../content/whatsapps/technofix-2.jpg){width=50%}

- Here's the [WhatsApp file](../../content/whatsapps/April%202024/WhatsApp%20Chat%20with%20Tecnofix%20Informatica.zip) of my communication with Tecnofix.

- I find the man I speak to in October rather strange, but, after all, I am on high-dosage hallucinogenic substances at this time.
- Although maybe even a little weirdness they'd usually get away with got exaggerated.
- He calls me by name, *Katterin* (sic).
- The spelling he used *Katterin* was how [Salva used to refer to me in choir](../2023/october.md#choir) and is likely sexually suggestive in colloquial Spanish/Valenciano, and is probably why Adriana and the other kids showed concern about his use of it.

## DPR cyber-expert Alicante

- I head to the DPR office with my devices and a copy of [the letter I wrote to them](march/13-end.md#cyber-expert).
- Roberto the lawyer has canceled our meeting, but tells me he can translate over the phone.
- I have very confused recollections of this morning except for feeling extraordinarily stressed and anxious, and out-of-my-mind for no particular reason I can ascertain.
- I put it down to everything that is happening, but it's not just that.
- When I speak to Roberto, I mention [the news report of the politician on spy-cam porn](https://www.timesnownews.com/world/europe/spanish-politician-daniel-gmez-del-barrio-resigns-after-photos-reveal-he-offered-himself-as-sex-slave-article-109256687) that I saw.
- I tell him this is what has been happening to me and I say it's epidemic.
- Roberto shuts the conversation theme down.
- I explain later on WhatsApp what I was trying to say.
- He hasn't formally told me he's not going to work with me so I assume he is still onside. This holds me back from looking for someone else.

??? info "WhatsApp with Roberto Rodriguez"
    19/04/2024, 18:47 - det sgt lydia cleaves: Done. Thanks for the help today :)</br>
    19/04/2024, 18:48 - det sgt lydia cleaves: They're gonna let me know when they're finished and I'll come and collect these things</br>
    19/04/2024, 18:48 - Robert Rodriguez: Cool</br>
    19/04/2024, 23:36 - det sgt lydia cleaves: Thanks for the help this week Robert. I'm confident we will get some results that will mean the police will take us seriously... The politician I was mentioning, I don't think he was hacked in the end, I think he wanted to be humiliated but Im certain that the hacking I'm suffering is epidemic .. anyway wishing you a wonderful weekend and I'll ping you as soon as there is any news 😊</br>
    19/04/2024, 23:53 - Robert Rodriguez: Ok but you need to be concerned only about your on case and about getting evidence now and after reporting It to make progress and stop the harassment. BEST weekenk</br>

- I am so stressed at the DPR office. 

!!! info "My state of mind that morning"
    - It's very weird but I have a feeling Roberto was there in person that morning, in his brown raincoat.
    - Does he have an extremely messy old-banger of a car? Did I get in this car at some point?
    - I was extremely stressed.
    - My mind was clearly overwhelmed at this time. 
    - I felt then, and now to a lesser extent, extremely absent-minded and forgetful, as if there was literally no space for any more information.
    - Was I close to cracking and having a nervous breakdown? 
    - I believe this is highly likely. 
    - Although the anxiety I experienced never approached the intense PTSD I had experienced as a child after sexual violence, and after the 2016 report to the Met which ironically was also to do with more recent sedated rape I didn't know about, I do remember shaking, and not being able to perform simple tasks, and I couldn't think or speak clearly at all.
    - My shoulders, arms, and hands ached.
    - I wonder if another [*distraction* event](../../crimes/poisoning.md#distraction-techniques-before-application) happened on my way to the Alicante offices.

- I meet David and his assistant and hand over my devices.
- I explain a little bit about what's happening and that I have been filmed sexually without my knowledge.
- Mostly, I pass the phone to them and Roberto does the talking. It might be good to get some clarification from DPR on what he said.
- I take the Asus Zenbook 13 that hackers [took over in France the summer previous](../2023/august.md#the-hackers-reveal-themselves), the Yoigo router, and two webcams.
- The lady assistant in the shop is bound to remember me as she looked very alarmed when I was telling her how I had been filmed sexually without my knowledge.
- Nevertheless, I feel that I probably can't trust anyone here either, so I only give them a few devices, and not the devices I am certain will come up positive for hacking.
- I give David the following devices:
    - My Asus Zenbook 13 laptop: He finds nothing on here so I ask him to reformat the device for me. This device could be rechecked now as it was connected again to my new Movistar router which was accessed by hackers immediately. On another reformat of this device in [December 2024](../2024/december.md#new-years-eve), they were in again in seconds. I have this device stored safely and believe the hardware is probably hacked.
    - The Yoigo router: David asks for the password to the router over WhatsApp after a long period of inactivity in which myself and my friend from Madrid are surprised we have had no communication from them. I give him the password. He subsequently says that he can't analyze routers. What did he need the password for then? I kept the router so we can check again.
    - Two security cameras: There was no storage card in one of the webcams so he could not check anything here. The other one gave no results. I don't know what happened to the card. I kept the security cam with the men making scary ghost noises on it secured safely for future analysis and never gave it to David.
- When I go to collect my devices in May, I pay 150 euros of the quoted 600.
- He's found nothing.
- He says he can check all my Twitter activity instead, so I give him both my account details and send full archives too.

## I get an Orange SIM

- I go to Orange in Dénia to get a SIM for my analog phone that cannot connect to Internet.
- I'm hoping that I can use it in emergencies and that I can't be followed using it in the way that I have been.
- The number they give me ends in 007.
- I buy another simple phone which won't have access to Internet on Amazon: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/your-account/order-details?ie=UTF8&orderID=203-8343216-4317911&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_order_details

## Constant stalking

- Even though I have left the conservatory, the stalking continues online and in person.
- I'm followed on a shopping trip to Iceland by a small wirey black-haired man who is hopping and dancing around as he tracks me around the isles.
- I'm followed on walks to Las Rotas and random people say disparaging things about me as they walk past, laugh and jeer, point and take photos.
- Every night, a car runs its engine outside my flats (and everyone else can hear it also of course), but it's just threatening the way whoever it is makes the car engine growl low, sometimes for hours, and often after midnight. 
- Everything is threatening to me now.
- I'm overwhelmed with sexual arousal yet again.

### Hackers seem to be annoyed

- A direct message springs up asking: "Why are your bank cards inaccessible?"

## Let that sink in

- Google search shows pictures of sinks, i.e. let that sink in.

![let that sink in](../../content/images/let-that-sink-in.jpg)

- The message, which took me ages to get, was a kind of middle finger to me after having to leave my piano studies.
- Someone posts about witches owning conservatories on Google search results, see below.

## Owns conservatory

- There is something going on regarding Helen Joyce and the fact she owns a conservatory makes her unable to know anything about trans people, or something like this: https://x.com/mcdonnelljp/status/1777747038832136465.
- It comes up top, and alone, on my Google searches on mobile. I don't even remember it very well but I notice the message which is quite amazing.

![owns conservatory](../../content/images/conservatory-1.JPG)

## The boys

- You can see the two boys in the conservatory pic above.
- The B.A. Feldman account and another account close to this one posted pictures of (apparently) themselves as boys back sometime in November 2023.
- I'm supposed to think these are [the trumpet teacher and his brother](../2023/december.md#the-trumpet-teacher-has-a-brother), although they don't look very much like twins so I'm not convinced.
- These pics remain to this day on my Google search and I only ever looked at them one time.

![Two boys pictures](../../content/images/google-searches/two-boys.png)

- Both boys are in this screenshot from my mobile.

![Littler boy](../../content/images/google-searches/littler-boy.JPG)

- The young man coming up in search since November 2023.

![Bigger boy](../../content/images/google-searches/google-search-young-man.png)

- The two boys even today.

![Two boys even today](../../content/images/google-searches/two-boys-today.png)

!!! important
    - As a reminder, these tweets were posted way back in November or December, and those posts have consequently been deleted or I cannot find them.
    - I looked at them once, and never again.
    - There is no reason for these two pics to keep on coming up unless they have some sticky cookie element, but they come up even after a reset to factory settings, so I don't understand how they do it, unless they have access to my Google accounts.
    - It's never clear why they would do this apart from to somehow keep the game/con/fraud going, so that I will continue to believe there is a reciprocal relationship going on in some weird way.
    - They are long-game honey-trappers, after all.

## Counting Omer

- I start counting the Omer on X: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1782868597125095773.

## Let women Speak

- Posey Parker (Kelly Jay Keen) is coming to do a Let women Speak event in Madrid in May.
- I apply to volunteer and be a steward.
- I'm also planning to speak too.

## The trumpet teacher in Dénia

- It must be the 28th April, a Sunday, I go to the Chinese restaurant.
- As I'm walking back home, I pass by a group of gypsies, a small girl running up beside me who I smile at and who gets shy and runs back to the group.
- They're following along behind me.
- I'm walking up the Calle Diana and I'm nearly at the end where the tunnel is, and sitting outside the tapas place is a man with the same build as the trumpet teacher, who is sitting with his back to me next to a small girl with blond hair.
- I believe this is now a trigger to kick off more romance feelings in myself.
- I believe the drugging with aphrodisiacs in the water at my flat is ramped up at this time.

## Fake account posts about "peeping at pre-schoolers"

- I notice a fake account that's interesting.
- I'm triggered to become interested and translate the message because of the picture of an eagle which is a meme that has been running throughout the cyber stalking.

![Initial trigger](../../content/images/fake-accounts/voyeurism-minors/1.jpg)

!!! warning
    - The photo of a the person with glasses here looks remarkably like an AI mix with me in it.

- I see "Peeking at adults is no..." translated so I open the image as it is clearly references voyeurism.

![Initial trigger opened](../../content/images/fake-accounts/voyeurism-minors/2.jpg)

- The translation read ""Peeping at adults is terrible but peeping at preschoolers is...". 

![Peeping at preschoolers](../../content/images/fake-accounts/voyeurism-minors/3.jpg)

!!! tip "August account with same triggers"
    - In August, a similar account likes something I've posted.
    - I describe this [here](august.md#hidden-camera-account).
    - It has the same eagle trigger, and Hebrew language as the one just mentioned.
    - I'm not sure if it is the same account. It could be.
    - The pinned thread on the timeline references a person targeted by someone who he had trusted, and had sex with, and was consequently stalked and filmed by secret cameras.
    - I assume this is to suggest the trumpet teacher was targeted by Domingo who has been blackmailing him in some way since then.
    - The account is here: https://x.com/Cr7Rival3711.
    - The pinned message is translated here:

    ![hidden cameras](../../content/images/fake-accounts/hidden-cameras.png)

    - In August, I respond to this terrible tweet thread that I have just read: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1823957507728896499.

## Body cam

- I buy a body cam and frame for security purposes.

## Twitter

- Tweets of interest to follow.
