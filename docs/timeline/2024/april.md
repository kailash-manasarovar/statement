## Jyotirlinga trip to India

- I leave Spain on 29th March and spend the first week of April on a tour in India with a friend.
- I stay at a posh hotel near the airport in Mumbai for a couple of days by myself in safety.
- I feel like I'm getting pneumonia I'm coughing so much.
- I crack the same rib [I cracked at yoga class](march/1-12.md#cracked-rib) from coughing in my hotel room.
- I'm coughing up blood now.
- I call the hotel doctor. He prescribes serious antibiotics and pleurisy medicine and says to call him in a day to let him know how I'm doing.
- I manage to [write to the Guardia Civil](march/13-end.md#letter-to-the-guardia-civil) and send the letter registered from the hotel.
- I'm meeting my friend Yan from Singapore.
- We are going to visit the five jyotirlinga temples in Maharashtra with a driver.
- I invite Yan for breakfast the day before we take the tour. I tell him what's been happening to me, what I know. I'm coughing so hard I can hardly speak.
- Later that evening, feeling a little better, I contact my mother directly from a mock email I've created on my phone.
- I send her a picture.

![Me in Mumbai](../../content/images/me-in-mumbai.jpg)

- This is the first time she has seen me in three-and-a-half years.
- I use the name of my mock email on my X profile for a short while.

![DCI Lydia Cleaves](../../content/images/lydia-cleaves-x-profile.jpg)

- Hackers have been more recently bombarding me with references to Elon Musk, hence the location reference.

### Bring him to Me

- I can't stop thinking about the trumpet teacher. 
- I think about him every thirty seconds or so. It's never ending, and inexplicable. 
- I deal with it as best I can.
- In retrospect, I'm definitely high on something. 
- That, coupled with the elevated divine energy on our tour may explain the following experience I had at Bhimashankar.
- Nandi, the little bull that Shiva uses for transport, always sits outside the Shiva temple looking in.
- They say if you whisper your wishes in Nandi's ear, he will grant them.
- At the first jyotirlinga temple we visit, [Bhimashankar](https://www.bhimashankar.in/), I whisper in Nandi's ear my wishes concerning the trumpet teacher.

![Bring him to Me](../../content/images/whispering-in-nandis-ear.png)

- In the queue I have been preparing what I want to ask for, the sentence is ready, but when I go to whisper my waffly request into Nandi's ear, something takes over.
- My whispered wish becomes a bold statement: *Bring him to me!*.
- And, at *exactly* the same time, matching every word of mine, I hear a booming voice coming from inside the temple saying, "Bring him to Me!".
- I have no non-God explanation for this - apart from the mandrake that I must have been ingesting unawares from my toiletries, and that's also a God-explanation depending on who you talk to.

## Lunch with Christine

- I return to Spain.
- Christine BJ arranges a hurried lunch. 
- She wants to know about my friend Yan, the man I traveled with in India.
- Who he is, how I know him, how old he is, what he does for a living, where he lives, what his parents do, and repeat.
- She asks me these questions over and over.
- I think it bizarre, and I'm perplexed that a random man in my life is way more interesting to her than the hell I'm enduring at home in Dénia.
- Was she sent to gather urgent intel on Yan and report back?
- Was it because I have a friend who the criminal gangs were previously unaware of?
- Did they do a bit of research on him and find something out something that caused them anxiety?
- Of course, the most worrying thing for a brave and bold criminal gang terrorizing a single woman living alone is if she is not, after all, alone. 
- Little did they know... although I did keep telling them.
- The inherent cowardice is off the scale.
- Whenever I get a chance to change the subject I explain to Christine what's been happening to me at the hands of Dénia criminals.
- Chris BJ maneuvers the conversation back into generalities.
- We speak about bullying.
- She tells me she was a bully at boarding school.
- I express the sane and world-saving idea that it is far better to be bullied than to be a bully.
- *Who in their right mind would want to be a bully?*, I announce with some passion.
- Her face flashes surprise.

## Dodgy lorry, van, and car registrations

- I had been noticing some odd-looking vans and cars outside Carrer Furs for quite some time, probably since early 2023.
- It didn't seem to be anything I had to be concerned with until September 2023, at which time I started to write down registration numbers whenever I had the wit to remember to do so.
- I remember a very weird van with blacked-out windows and a big aerial, maybe even a satellite dish, parked right below my window every day.
- There were also similarly bizarre looking vans along the back road too.
- Given I live in a seaside town, and the beach is at the bottom of the road, I just assumed that these vehicles belonged to regular people living in vans by the sea and having their own Internet access. Sounds rather nice although a bit cramped.
- When the multiple cars started to [beep outside my apartment every day in a threatening manner as they drove past](may.md#cars-beeping-outside), I began to more assiduously take registration numbers.
- I had them on notes in the apartment, which I misplaced eventually, and sometimes I added them to my phone.
- Here's a small list from April 2024 I found on the Android phone I bought in the [Chinese telecom store in Madrid](march/13-end.md#madrid).

![List of dodgy registrations](../../content/images/car-regs.jpg)

## Response from the Generalitat

- On my return, I receive a letter from the Generalitat dated the 2nd April 2024, and signed on 3rd April 2024.
- It is in response to my numerous complaints.
- They basically say they investigated and found nothing untoward going on.
- It's not clear what reports they requested, or from whom, or what's in them.
- The investigation they are referring to having done was the [inspector ambushing me at piano lesson on 5th March](march/1-12.md#an-inspector-calls) and bullying me even more for about five minutes.
- I'm not sure what they are referring to when they mention "former students". As far as I'm aware, I mentioned nothing about any former students.
- I did, in fact, state repeatedly I was concerned for the safety of *current* students as I have also stated in this police statement numerous times.

??? tip "Translation of the Generalitat's response into English"
    Alicante, April 2, 2024

    On October 22, 2023, she sent a letter to the Ministry of Education, in which she stated that she was being harassed by the teachers and staff of the Professional Conservatory of Music Mestre Tenor Cortis de Dénia, specifically indicating that she had suffered: harassment by gangs on social networks, cyberbullying, personal harassment by teachers and staff of the conservatory, damage to her personal property by teachers and staff; and harassment on the street by strangers. She also referred to Mr. Domingo Cano who was her piano teacher during the 14/15 academic year. Subsequently, she has sent different emails in which she exposes the same facts in which former students of the center would also be involved.

    The Education Inspectorate has carried out several actions in order to clarify the reported facts. Reports have been requested from the management team and an interview was held with the interested party herself, in which, among other things, she was informed that the Inspectorate had sent her a letter of reply dated 19/12/23, however, since the postal address she had provided was incomplete, it was returned by the postal service.

    Regarding the facts referred to, it should be noted that you have been enrolled in the Professional Conservatory of Music Tenor "Cortis" in the 2014/2015, 2015/2016. 2022/2023 and the current 2023/2024 years in the piano specialty, having received classes from about twelve different teachers and that you only received classes from Mr. Domingo Cano at the beginning of the 2014/15 school year, because the teacher was changed at your request.

    For all this, the investigations carried out show that there has been no evidence that any teacher has behaved inappropriately towards students at the centre and there are no complaints regarding any type of personal harassment or damage to their property, or towards any other student, in which conservatory staff may have participated. Likewise, the Inspectorate has not received any complaint from any parent or student on this issue.

    For all this, given that most of what you are referring to has occurred outside the scope of the conservatory, if you consider that there are facts that could constitute a criminal offense, you must contact the competent judicial authority to proceed with the corresponding complaint.

    In any case, the educational inspection will continuously monitor the activity of the center, advising the educational agents who are intervening in order to guarantee correct attention to the students and promote their well-being and academic development.

## Leak resumes

- One morning when I go to collect the car, I notice the [leak from the windscreen washing fluid tank](../2023/september.md#problem-with-my-car) has started again.
- I text Pedro the caretaker about it.

![Text Pedro about the leak](../../content/whatsapps/chat-about-the-leak-with%20pedro.jpg)

- Here's the downloaded [WhatsApp](../../content/whatsapps/April%202024/WhatsApp%20Chat%20with%20CONSERJE%20VILLAMAR.zip) chat.
- Eventually, we talk in person and I agree to Pedro's suggestion that his friend the mechanic comes to have a look at the problem.
- Pedro's friend comes to check my car the following day but can't find any problem.
- He tells me I will have to bring the car to the workshop.
- His workshop is quite far away in the industrial polygon.
- I don't want to leave my car with someone I don't know, and I don't know how I will travel there and back.
- Pedro, excited, tells me not to worry he will take me there and back himself, in his car.
- My body screams at me that it's a set up, maybe to get me alone with Pedro. Pedro is [a bit pervy](../2023/september.md#pedro-ogles-a-tourist), you see.
- I immediately say no and walk away.
- Pedro looks ashamed.
- After this, the leaks stops and/or is intermittent.
- In June when I'm in the UK, I take the car to Kwik Fit in London N12.
- They fix a broken motor in the window washer function of my car and tell me there's no leak at all.
- I believe Pedro, or others known to him, were able to access my car engine and cause what looked like a leak, but wasn't.
- I wondered if, by the same methods, criminals added some mind-altering substance that could come in through the air vents, or something I could touch on the door handles, wheel, or gearstick maybe.
- Could this be what caused [overwhelming sexual arousal on Hanuman Jayanti in 2023](../2023/april.md#hanuman-jayanti)?
- I eventually told Pedro that I had been filmed sexually without my knowledge, and that I would pay 500 euros for any recordings.
- He was fired very soon after that and replaced by an unusually surly man.
- Pedro [sends me a text at Christmas](december.md#pedro-sends-a-christmas-greeting).
- He tells me is just back from visiting a family at Carrer Furs.
- Did they hire him back once they were done with me?

!!! danger "Connections"
    - Reading this back reminds me that one of the targeted women the criminals sent multiple pictures of ended up in a car garage somewhere, clearly sedated, in increasing states of undress in the front seat and the back seat of a [grey sports car](september.md#another-upsetting-targeted-woman).
    - In one of the photos, you can see a small Hispanic man crouching down in the foot of the drivers side of the car, giving a sense of many people being around while these photos were taken.

## Resigning from the conservatory

- I send resignation letters to Paqui via email on Monday 8th April.
- I explain to her how I am genuinely afraid for my life, and how whatever is happening concerns Lorraine Blackbourn's untimely death.

    Carrer Furs 15</br>
    Portal 1, ESC2, Piso 3, Apt 17</br>
    Denia</br>
    03700 Alicante</br>
    Monday 8th April 2024</br>
    </br>
    To whom it may concern,</br>
    </br>
    After a two-year campaign of gender violence in the form of bullying, aggression, and 
    psychological intimidation by teachers and staff at the Tenor Cortis conservatory in Denia, I now have sufficient fear for my personal safety that I will no longer be coming to classes.</br>
    </br>
    The latest flurry of violent imagery and messages on Twitter, and the psychological bullying at the piano concert on Tuesday 12th March - in which a woman dressed up to look exactly like a friend, Lorraine Blackbourn, who tragically committed suicide in Denia after gender-based bullying and intimidation - I consider to signify a genuine threat to my life.</br>
    </br>
    I previously understood the bullying to come from a small number of teachers and staff, and their families/friends on the streets of Denia, as I mentioned many times in my private letters of complaint I wrote to the Generalitat. As you know, these letters were ignored completely. I 
    received no reply at all. They were, instead, shared with teachers and staff at the conservatory.</br>
    </br>
    Sharing these letters was obviously going to put me in even more danger at the school, online, 
    and in the streets of Denia.</br>
    </br>
    I believe there are also private and stolen photos, recordings, and videos of me; hacked with the sole intention of shaming and silencing me, perhaps blackmailing too, and it concerns me that other students, especially young women and children, may be suffering in the same way. I have informed numerous authorities about this.</br>
    </br>
    I now realize, albeit belatedly, that literally everyone at the school, teachers, staff, and students, and even the Generalitat itself - whether intentionally or because they are too scared to do otherwise - are firmly in support of me having to leave the school due to gender violence.</br>
    </br>
    It is very shocking to me that a public institution funded by taxpayers could so easily treat a 
    student in this way. And it is not a unique event.</br>
    </br>
    It remains to be said that at the conservatory in Denia, with the support of the Generalitat, there appears to be zero concern for the safety and wellbeing of students at the school who complain about inappropriate behavior from teachers and staff.</br>
    </br>
    As I mentioned many times, the campaign of terror relates to me refusing a piano teacher who 
    had sought a romantic relationship with me 10 years ago.</br>
    </br>
    There is also some suggestion that the collective hatred towards me has been further incited with reference to my political views on Twitter.</br>
    </br>
    I myself have only ever wanted to play the piano in peace.</br>
    </br>
    With the very best,</br>
    Dra Katharine Murphy

### Paqui's response

- Paqui responds via email on Tuesday 9th April.

![Paqui's response](../../content/documents/emails/paquis-response-to-my-resignation-letter.jpg)

??? info "Translation of Paqui's response"
    Hello Katharine

    I'm sorry to read the letter you sent me.

    First of all, I want you to know that no private letters have been shared; in fact, I haven't seen them either. However, I am aware that the letters haven't been ignored.

    We went to the police this morning to explain your situation. You need to report this to law enforcement, providing some kind of proof to verify your statement, so they can investigate.

    I am available for anything you need

    Paqui Fornet

- I respond, asking her to confirm what they went to the police about.

![Asking what they went to the police about](../../content/documents/emails/ask-to-know-what-she-went-to-the-police-about.jpg)

- She ignores my email. 
- I never knowingly hear from her again.
- Here's the [full resignation email thread with Paqui](../../content/documents/emails/Full-resignation-email-thread.pdf).
- I carbon-copy the UK embassy and the Irish embassy into the email in case I'm arrested by the police.
- The mention of the police, together with the [suggestion from the Generalitat's inspector that she was going to report *me* to the police](march/1-12.md#an-inspector-calls), and my friend in Madrid's suggestion I could be arrested for defamation, triggers another strong PTSD reaction.
- I become convinced, yet again, I'm going to be arrested for some undisclosed matter.
- I believe this belief was being heavily reinforced by online manipulation during this period.
- I believe this is an irrational terror that was first triggered in my mind in 1989 by the Tottenham rape gangs, and how they very effectively silence children who have some respect for law enforcement.
- You could ask Winston May or Colin Dale about that, I guess.
- Certainly, the Generalitat and Paqui Fornet also, somehow, seemed to be aware that this was an effective manner of frightening and silencing me.

### Paqui account

- The fake account with a (what I find at this moment to be an even more) threatening picture of Paqui appears again on my X account notifications.

![Paqui](../../content/images/fake-accounts/paqui1.png)

- I believe they posted these pics of Paqui to *ensure* I didn't think about returning to the conservatory.
- This is a screenshot from the end of March of one of the other accounts that had her picture: https://x.com/Zingley2. 

![Paqui on 28th March](../../content/images/threats/paqui2-zingley.png)

- This picture continues to appear on Google search results.
- There was a bunch of accounts like this at the time, and once again in September 2024, perhaps to ensure I didn't try and return to my studies!
- No, I was safely handed-over by the conservatory to the porn-gangs for their pleasure and Ferrari payments.

## The third time I'm convinced I'm going to be arrested

- I believe I'm going to be arrested at any moment. 
- As [in the second time the August previous](../2023/august.md#i-become-convinced-im-going-to-be-arrested), I carry my copy of A Course In Miracles, text and workbook, in my bag wherever I go, just in case, until the certainty wears off.

    <source src="../../../content/sounds/i-have-the-feeling-im-going-to-be-arrested.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

- Given the outrageous behavior of teachers and staff at the conservatory, and the police's disinterest, and the seriousness of what's been happening to me, I'm quite sure that anything is possible.
- I guess a lot of these fears are also being triggered by hackers and stalkers online.
- I search for a lawyer and send an [email to a number of lawyers in the region asking for help](../../content/documents/emails/worried-the-conservatory-will-accuse-me-of-defamation.png).
- I get a response from someone and I video a call with them. The following videos are me talking to a lawyer looking for help. 
- I'm obviously extremely stressed and scared.

    - [Video of me speaking about this at this time - part 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PbJYX7DG0pjAPE3Jh7OoyW5k9urXcDZE/view?usp=sharing).
    - [Video of me speaking about this at this time - part 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kT-BFILgBWnVTBALHepboNzpGCxBoi4f/view?usp=drive_link).

- I contacted so many lawyers, I'm not sure why I didn't go ahead with any of them. 
- I'm not even sure who Lisa was now I was so stressed at the time. I'll add her details here when I find them. I guess she could have been someone connected to the criminal gangs.
- In response to one email I sent, I received a notification that my message had been blocked by the server. This was: https://carbrayinternational.com/.
- Eventually, I find a lawyer who can help me if I'm arrested who speaks English. He can also help me with any translating.
- I believe now he is likely connected to the criminal gangs and it was easy to direct me to him because, as we have seen, they have full access to my devices and online use in real time.

![Roberto the lawyer, apparently](../../content/whatsapps/roberto-laywer.jpg)

!!! info
    - It's very weird but I cannot remember if I met him in person or not in Alicante at [DPR](../../content/documents/letters/Ampliacion%20Denuncia_Katharine.pdf).
    - I was extremely stressed and had a long conversation with him, I can't remember when now.
    - My mind was clearly overwhelmed at this time. I felt then, and now to a lesser extent, extremely absent-minded and forgetful, as if there is literally no space for any more information.
    - Was I close to cracking and having a nervous breakdown? I believe this is possible. 
    - Although the anxiety I experienced this year never approached the intense anxiety I had experienced as PTSD from sexual violence, I do remember shaking, and not being able to perform simple tasks, and I couldn't think or speak clearly at all.
    - I also wonder if they were drugging me again through the water at home or some other way?

## Search for Vidal Sastre

- I periodically search for references for "Vidal Sastre Sanchez Hornero".
- There are relatively few on 15th April. However, I do note the name is listed on published Generalitat lists.

![Sastre on the GV lists](../../content/documents/evidence/sastre-gv.png)

- It seems the team have been involved in numerous heinous crimes against women and girls; paying porn-addicts the world over delighting in the sexual excitement generated by their vile, twisted and murderous acts.

## Final chat with Jorge

## Hacking expert

- I take the Asus Zenbook 13 that they took over in France the summer previous, the Yoigo router, and two webcams which I believe they accessed to the expert at DPR in Alicante.
- I meet David and his assistant.
- The lawyer helps with translating, I believe over the phone, but he may have been present.
- I tell them about how they have sexual films of me. I'm clearly very upset.
- The lady in the shop is bound to remember me as she looked very alarmed when I was telling her how I had been filmed sexually without my knowledge.
- However, I feel that I probably can't trust anyone here, so I only give them a few devices, and not the devices I am certain will come up positive for hacking.
- I give them the following:
    - My Asus Zenbook 13 laptop: He finds nothing on here so I ask him to reformat the device for me. This device could be rechecked now as it was connected again to my new Movistar router which was accessed by hackers immediately it was installed.
    - The Yoigo router: He asks for the password to the router. I give it to him. He then says that he can't analyze routers. Why did he need the password then? I kept the router so we can check again.
    - Two security cameras: There was no storage card in one of the webcams so he could not check anything here. I don't know what happened to the card.
- When I go to collect my devices, I pay 150 euros and he says he can check all my Twitter activity instead, so I give him both my account details and send Twitter archives too.
- I have never heard back from him on any of it.
- Here is my [WhatsApp](../../content/whatsapps/April%202024/WhatsApp%20Chat%20with%20DPR%20Recovery%20Alicante%20-%20GoldenPhone%20informática.zip) messages to him.

## Roberto Rodriguez, lawyer

- The same day a man has been removed from political office in Toledo after spy cam porn was released of him. I find this very similar to what's going on for me and say it's epidemic to the lawyer. He basically tells me to be quiet.
- The Roberto Rodriguez thing is a very dodgy business.
- I am so stressed in the DPR office, it seems he is with me, but I don't think he ever came.
- Roberto gives me the Technofix details and insists I call them, but I have already gone with DPR.
- Here's the [WhatsApp with Roberto](../../content/whatsapps/WhatsApp%20Chat%20with%20Robert%20Rodriguez.zip).
- I contact them but they do not reply.
- In October, I call them apparently by accident, a man is rather strange on the phone to me, and I receive a very weird [WhatsApp message](../../content/whatsapps/April%202024/WhatsApp%20Chat%20with%20Tecnofix%20Informatica.zip) where he calls me by name, *Katterin* (sic), but I have no recollection of ever speaking with this man.
- The name he used *Katterin* was how [Salva used to refer to me in choir](../2023/october.md#choir) and is likely sexually suggestive in colloquial Spanish and is probably why Adriana and the other kids were a bit concerned about his use of it.
- Move WhatsApps content into here: todo:
- Here's a couple of pics, all content to be organized shortly.

![Roberto R 2](../../content/images/roberto-rodriguez/roberto-rodriguez-2.jpg)

## I get an Orange SIM

- I go to Orange in Dénia to get a SIM for my analog phone that cannot connect to Internet.
- I'm hoping that I can use it in emergencies and that I can't be followed using it in the way that I have been.
- The number they give me ends in 007.
- I buy another simple phone which won't have access to Internet on Amazon: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/your-account/order-details?ie=UTF8&orderID=203-8343216-4317911&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_order_details

## Constant stalking

- Even though I have left the conservatory, the stalking continues online and in person.
- I'm followed on a shopping trip to Iceland by a small wirey black-haired man who is hopping and dancing around as he tracks me around the isles.
- I'm followed on walks to Las Rotas and random people say disparaging things about me as they walk past, laugh and jeer, point and take photos.
- Every night, a car runs its engine outside my flats (and everyone else can hear it also of course), but it's just threatening the way whoever it is makes the car engine growl low, sometimes for hours, and often after midnight. 
- Everything is threatening to me now.
- I'm overwhelmed with sexual arousal yet again.

### Hackers seem to be annoyed

- A direct message springs up asking: "Why are your bank cards inaccessible?"

## Let that sink in

- Google search shows pictures of sinks, i.e. let that sink in.

![let that sink in](../../content/images/let-that-sink-in.jpg)

- The message, which took me ages to get, was a kind of middle finger to me after having to leave my piano studies.
- Someone posts about witches owning conservatories on Google search results, see below.

## Owns conservatory

- There is something going on regarding Helen Joyce and the fact she owns a conservatory makes her unable to know anything about trans people, or something like this: https://x.com/mcdonnelljp/status/1777747038832136465.
- It comes up top, and alone, on my Google searches on mobile. I don't even remember it very well but I notice the message which is quite amazing.

![owns conservatory](../../content/images/conservatory-1.JPG)
![owns conservatory](../../content/images/conservatory-2.JPG)

## The boys

- You can see the two boys in the conservatory pic above.
- The B.A. Feldman account and another account close to this one posted pictures of (apparently) themselves as boys back sometime in November 2023.
- I'm supposed to think these are [the trumpet teacher and his brother](../2023/december.md#the-trumpet-teacher-has-a-brother), although they don't look very much like twins so I'm not convinced.
- These pics remain to this day on my Google search and I only ever looked at them one time.

- Both boys are in this screenshot from my mobile.

- The two boys even today.

!!! important
    - As a reminder, these tweets were posted way back in November or December, and those posts have consequently been deleted or I cannot find them.
    - I looked at them once, and never again.
    - There is no reason for these two pics to keep on coming up unless they have some sticky cookie element, but they come up even after a reset to factory settings, so I don't understand how they do it, unless they have access to my Google accounts.
    - It's never clear why they would do this apart from to somehow keep the game/con/fraud going, so that I will continue to believe there is a reciprocal relationship going on in some weird way.
    - They are long-game honey-trappers, after all.

## Counting Omer

## Let women Speak

- Posey Parker (Kelly Jay Keen) is coming to do a Let women Speak event in Madrid in May.
- I apply to volunteer and be a steward.
- I'm also planning to speak too.

## The trumpet teacher in Dénia

- It must be the 28th April, a Sunday, I go to the Chinese restaurant.
- As I'm walking back home, I pass by a group of gypsies, a small girl running up beside me who I smile at and who gets shy and runs back to the group.
- They're following along behind me.
- I'm walking up the Calle Diana and I'm nearly at the end where the tunnel is, and sitting outside the tapas place is a man with the same build as the trumpet teacher, who is sitting with his back to me next to a small girl with blond hair.
- I believe this is now a trigger to kick off more romance feelings in myself.
- I believe the drugging with aphrodisiacs in the water at my flat is ramped up at this time.

## Fake account posts about "peeping at pre-schoolers"

- I notice a fake account that's interesting.
- I'm triggered to become interested and translate the message because of the picture of an eagle which is a meme that has been running throughout the cyber stalking.

![Initial trigger](../../content/images/fake-accounts/voyeurism-minors/1.jpg)

!!! warning
    - The photo of a the person with glasses here looks remarkably like an AI mix with me in it.

- I see "Peeking at adults is no..." translated so I open the image as it is clearly references voyeurism.

![Initial trigger opened](../../content/images/fake-accounts/voyeurism-minors/2.jpg)

- The translation read ""Peeping at adults is terrible but peeping at preschoolers is...".

!!! tip "August account with same triggers"
    - In August, a similar account likes something I've posted.
    - I describe this [here](august.md#hidden-camera-account).
    - It has the same eagle trigger, and Hebrew language as the one just mentioned.
    - I'm not sure if it is the same account. It could be.
    - The pinned thread on the timeline references a person targeted by someone who he had trusted, and had sex with, and was consequently stalked and filmed by secret cameras.
    - I assume this is to suggest the trumpet teacher was targeted by Domingo who has been blackmailing him in some way since then.
    - The account is here: https://x.com/Cr7Rival3711.
    - The pinned message is translated here:

    ![hidden cameras](../../content/images/fake-accounts/hidden-cameras.png)

    - In August, I respond to this terrible tweet thread that I have just read: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1823957507728896499.

## Body cam
