## Away from Spain

- I am away from Spain for the first week of April.

## Lawyer

- I have found a lawyer who can help me with translating.
- I believe now he is very much connected to the criminal gangs.

## Hacking expert

- I take one laptop, the Yoigo router, and a webcam which I believe they have accessed to the expert in Alicante.
- The lawyer helps with translating.
- I'm in a state.
- However, I know I probably can't trust anyone here.

## Constant stalking



## Rat poison references on Twitter

## Let that sink in

## Owns conservatory
