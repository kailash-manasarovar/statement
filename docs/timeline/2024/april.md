## Away from Spain

- I am away from Spain for the first week of April.

## Lawyer

- I have found a lawyer who can help me with translating.
- I believe now he is very much connected to the criminal gangs.

## Hacking expert

- I take one laptop, the Yoigo router, and a webcam which I believe they have accessed to the expert in Alicante.
- The lawyer helps with translating.
- I'm in a state.
- However, I know I probably can't trust anyone here.

## I buy an analogue phone

- I go to Orange in Denia to buy a phone that cannot connect to internet so I can't be followed in the way that I have been.
- The number ends in 007.
