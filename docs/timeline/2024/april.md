## Away from Spain

- I am away from Spain for the first week of April.

## Response from Generalitat

- I receive a letter from the Generalitat in response to my complaints on 3rd April 2024 and pick it up on my return.
- It basically says they investigated and found nothing at all.

## Leak resumes

- The leak from my car washer resumes. I text Pedro the caretaker about it.

- The friend Pedro had mentioned back in September comes to check my car but doesn't see anything and tells me I have to bring it to the workshop.
- I don't want to leave my car with someone I don't know, and I don't know how I will travel there and back.
- Pedro tells me he will take me himself in his car.
- It all feels like a set up to get me alone with Pedro and I say no.
- Pedro is a bit pervy, you see.
- The leaks stops and/or is intermittent.
- The following June, my garage in North London fix a broken motor in the window washer function of my car and tell me there's no leak at all.
- I believe Pedro may be involved in adding narcotics to my car in some way, or knows something. If anyone tampered with my car in the garage, he would know.
- I wondered if they managed to add something to come through the air vents, or something I could touch on the door handles maybe.
- I told Pedro that I had been filmed sexually and I would pay 500 euros for any recordings.
- He was fired soon after.

## Resign from the conservatory

- I send resignation letters to Paqui via email on Monday 8th April.

    - [Email receipt of sending](../../content/documents/emails/12.%20Email%20receipt%20of%20resigation%20letter.png).

## Paqui's response

- Paqui responds via email on Tuesday 9th April.
    - [Paqui's response](../../content/documents/emails/14.%20Paqui's%20reply%20to%209%20April%20email.png).
- She says they have gone to the police that morning to "explain my situation", she also says she is "at my disposition for anything I might need".
- I ask her to confirm what they went to the police about.
- She ignores me.
- I think this triggers a PTSD reaction from the cyber stalking because I become convinced again I'm going to be arrested for some undisclosed matter, my friend suggests defamation.

## Fake account with teachers on

- Paqui fake account.

## Triggers me again

- I think they are going to arrest me again
- I guess a lot of this is also triggered online

## Lawyer

- Search for a lawyer email
- I have found a lawyer who can help me with translating.
- I believe now he is probably connected to the criminal gangs.

![Robert the lawyer](../../content/whatsapps/roberto-laywer.jpg){width=45%}

!!! info
    - It's very weird but I cannot remember if I met him in person or not in Alicante.
    - I was extremely stressed and had a long conversation with him prior to leaving Denia before Easter.
    - My mind was clearly so overwhelmed at this time, and now remembering everything, I feel extremely absent-minded and forgetful, as if there is literally no space for all this information.
    - Was I close to cracking?
    - Were they drugging me again through the car ventilator?

## Hacking expert

- I take one laptop, the Yoigo router, and a webcam which I believe they have accessed to the expert in Alicante.
- The lawyer helps with translating, I believe over the phone.
- I'm in a total state and the lady in the shop is bound to remember me.
- I tell them about how they have sexual films of me and I'm clearly very upset.
- However, I know I probably can't trust anyone here so I only give them a few devices, and not the devices I know will come up positive for sure.

## I get an Orange SIM

- I go to Orange in Denia to get a SIM for my analog phone that cannot connect to internet so I can't be followed in the way that I have been.
- The number ends in 007.

## Constant stalking


## Followed to Iceland


## Let that sink in
