## UK and Belgium

- I do not come last in the election on the 7th July to go to Brussels for a crypto conference with work.
- I'm in Belgium till the 11th
- When I'm in Belgium, I manage to access the ECHR website correctly and easily find a way to report what is going on for me. I receive a response in early August to my letter.

    - [Response from ECHR to letter written in Brussels on 8th July](../../content/documents/evidence/ARES%202024_5484609.pdf).
- I return back to London and get the boat from Portsmouth back to Spain with the car.

## Denia

- I'm back in Denia on 15th July. 
- The communication with the hacker begins again in earnest.
- It starts in a very interesting way.
- A post comes up on my JackChardwood account referencing *strawberries* on July 17th, and something about staying or leaving.
- I like the post and say something about how I won't be leaving as I've nowhere else to go.
- Suddenly, literally within minutes, 1000s of accounts view this post.

- This is extraordinary. I've never seen anything like it on my JC account which gets no views at all usually.
- And for this to happen on a tweet about "strawberries". Well, there is no doubt this is evidence of cyber stalking.
- And not only that, but the fact that the cyber stalkers/hackers have technology that can generate this sort of intense activity on Twitter at the drop of a hat. 
- It must be expensive technology.
- I tell my friend in Madrid (who doesn't really understand what I'm saying) and the expert in Alicante about this.
- I explain it very clearly to the expert, with screenshots.
- I never hear anything from the expert in Alicante about this or anything else.
- See page 5 of the [email thread to the perito]([perito in Alicante](../../content/documents/evidence/comms-with-perito.pdf).

## Sexual arousal

- During the time I am back in Denia over this month I am extraordinarily sexually aroused and masturbate often.

## Big chat with the hacker

- A conversation begins with the hacker(s) at that point which goes on all summer.
- We talk via my profile account message, and responses in fake account profiles.
- The conversation starts with me being astonished at the level of technology the hacker has at his fingertips. I realize it's his job.
- He confirms this.
- I believe I'm talking to the trumpet teacher still, or someone close to him.
- We make references to things that have happened between us, that no one could know unless he told them.
- I feel extremely sexually aroused these last two weeks in July before I leave for Lourdes.
- It's important to note that I felt nothing while I was away, it's only when I come back to Denia and stay in my flat. 
- I don't go out much now it feels so dangerous.
- I masturbate and sometimes it feels like the trumpet teacher is in my head while this is happening. 
- Comments on fake accounts talk about things that have happened which people could *only* know if there were hidden cameras in my apartment.

## I see Mercedes in the Carrefour

- I go to the Carrefour and Mercedes is behind me in the queue.
- She looks ashamed.
