## UK

- I leave the UK on 5th July.

## Belgium

- I'm at a crypto conference in Belgium 8-11th
- ECHR (reference March)

## Denia

- Back in Denia a short while. The communication begins again in earnest.
- It starts in a very interesting way.
- A post comes up on my JackChardwood account referencing strawberries and something about staying or leaving.
- I like the post and say something about how I won't be leaving as I've nowhere else to go.
- Suddenly, 1000s of accounts like this post.
- This is extraordinary. I've never seen anything like it on my JC account which gets no views at all.
- And for this to happen on a tweet about "strawberries". Well, there is no doubt this is evidence of cyber stalking.
- I tell my friend in Madrid and the expert in Alicante about this.
- I explain it very clearly with screenshots.
- We never hear anything from the expert in Alicante.

## DÃ©nia

- Nowhere to go ..
- Expert

## Big chat with the hacker

- The chat begins and goes on till he tells me about Irene, plate lady, and I look her up and find her.

## I see Mercedes in the Carrefour

- I go to the Carrefour and Mercedes is behind me in the queue.
- She looks embarrassed. She should be.
