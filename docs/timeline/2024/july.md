## UK and Belgium

- I do not come last in the election on the 4th July, second to last. I can't wait to run again.
- I to go to Brussels for a crypto conference with work.
- I'm in Belgium till the 11th July.
- When I'm in Belgium, I manage to access the ECHR website correctly and easily find a way to report what is going on for me. I receive a response in early August to my letter.
    - [Receipt of sending from European Commission website](../../content/documents/evidence/eu-complaint.png).
    - [Response from ECHR to letter written in Brussels on 8th July](../../content/documents/evidence/ARES%202024_5484609.pdf).
- I return back to London and get the boat from Portsmouth back to Spain with the car.

## Evidence of mass cyber stalking technology

- I'm back in Denia on 15th July. 
- I was not sexually aroused at all while I'm away.
- After a couple of days back in Denia, the sexual arousal starts up again.
- Morever, communication with the hacker begins again in earnest.
- It starts in a very interesting way.
- A post comes up on my `@JackChardwood` account referencing [*strawberries*](../2023/october.md#strawberries) on July 17th, and something about staying or leaving. 
- It also reads like a direct threat to me if I stay.
- I like the post and say something about how I won't be leaving as I've nowhere else to go.
- Suddenly, literally within minutes, 1000s of accounts view this post.

- This is extraordinary. I've never seen anything like it on my JC account which gets no views at all usually.
- And for this to happen on a tweet about "strawberries". Well, there is no doubt this is evidence of cyber stalking.
- And not only that, but the fact that the cyber stalkers/hackers have technology that can generate this sort of intense activity on Twitter at the drop of a hat. 
- It must be expensive technology. Why would they be using such technology, such resources, to terrorize a lone and vulnerable foreign woman in Denia? It doesn't make any sense.
- I tell my friend in Madrid (who doesn't really understand what I'm saying) and the expert in Alicante about this.
- I explain it very clearly to the expert, with screenshots; See page 5 of the [email thread to the perito](../../content/documents/evidence/comms-with-perito.pdf).
- I never hear anything from the expert in Alicante about this or anything else.
- My friend phones him repeatedly for updates and the receptionist fobs her off.

## Sexual arousal

- During the time I am back in Denia over this month I am extraordinarily sexually aroused and masturbate often.

## Big chat with the hacker begins

- A conversation begins with the hacker(s) at that point which goes on all summer.
- We talk via my Twitter account's profile message, and they response to me in fake account profile messages.
- Here's an example of how I might ask them something.

- And here's an example of how they might reply.

![twitter reply](../../content/images/threats/marc-panico.png)

- The conversation starts with me being astonished at the level of technology the hacker has at his fingertips. I realize it's his job.
- He confirms this.
- He says he wasn't expecting me to run for election.
- I believe I'm talking to the trumpet teacher still, or someone close to him.
- I joke about "whipping them up into a frenzy" and post tweets saying we're going for coffee and such like.
- He replies he never goes out but I say I'm just messing with them.
- I use this phrase from time to time: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1779265814186610831 as it references the way Domingo is somehow able to get the little girls all excited and nervous, giggly and embarrassed around him.
- Down at the beach, young men come up to me and make references to coffee.
- In this unusual way, we chat about things that have happened between us, that no one could know unless he told them, or is telling them; private looks we made to each other for example. I'm sure it's the trumpet teacher.
- I feel extremely sexually aroused these last two weeks in July before I leave for Lourdes.
- It's important to note that I felt no sexual arousal while I was away, it's only when I come back to Denia and stay in my flat that this begins again.
- I don't go out much now as it feels so dangerous but I try to go to the beach in the afternoon as there are a lot of people there, tourists.
- I wear my hiker's camera on these outings.
- I masturbate and sometimes it feels like the trumpet teacher is in my head while this is happening. 
- Comments on fake accounts talk about things that have happened with regards to my sexual arousal which people could *only* know if there were hidden cameras in my apartment.

## I see Mercedes in the Carrefour

- I go to the Carrefour and Mercedes is behind me in the queue.
- She looks ashamed.
- I put my thumbs up to the cashier who laughs.

## Google search

- The Ana pic comes up a lot on Google search.
- This was posted the day Ana Girbes became enraged at me and shouted about my private health matter than only someone who had access to my laptop could possibly know about.
