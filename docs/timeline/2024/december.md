- There is no doubt in my mind that what I have experienced at the hands of teachers and staff at the conservatory of Denia, their friends and family, would drive a person to suicide.
- I suggest investigators check all suicide stats and untimely deaths of anyone complaining about being terrorized or harassed.
- I would also double check any women that may have been accused of being "hysterical" or similar when making similar gang stalking claims.
