- There is no doubt in my mind that what I have experienced at the hands of teachers and staff at the conservatory of Denia, their friends and family, could give a person a nervous breakdown or drive them to suicide.
- I suggest investigators check all local suicide stats and untimely deaths of anyone, particular young people, who have a history of complaining about being terrorized or harassed in any way.
- I would also double check any women that may have been accused of being "hysterical" or similar when making similar gang stalking claims.
- I suggest that gang stalkers are prosecuted for attempted murder.
- I suggest that anyone found involved in poisoning or drugging is prosecuted for attempted murder.
- I suggest that anyone found involved in sexual grooming is prosecuted for sexual abuse and/or rape.
- I suggest that, where possible, the bodies of any suspicious deaths in the region are exhumed and analyzed for poisons and narcotics.
- I suggest that, all previous residents in my flat or any flat managed by anyone related to these matters, is questioned.
