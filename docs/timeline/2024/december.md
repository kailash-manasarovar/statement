## Unable to access my laptop

- Sunday 1st December, my laptop is inaccessible. The password does not work at all.
- I change the password regularly and it worked a few days ago.
- I believe hackers have infiltrated my machine and forced me to have to reformat it again.
- I was unable to recover access myself and had to get help from a [local technician here in Bangkok](../../content/images/reformat-machine.JPG) where I'm staying.
- I lose a bunch of *extremely* interesting screenshots taken over the month of November - since I last reformated the machine - in the process. These include:
    - More pictures of targeted women.
    - Pictures of possums.
    - A picture of a woman I saw on the beach but about 20 years younger.
    - A very threatening picture of a man (rather like the [picture of the gypsy I saw in France](august.md#followed-by-the-gypsy-in-france).
    - Direct references to Domingo and Carmen Cano, poison and murder.
- Fortunately, I already posted some of them, such as the [threat to my brother's life](november.md#a-threat-to-my-brothers-life) as the hackers were getting extremely bold over November. I'll try to find some of the accounts I interacted with.
- When I look at Twitter on my mobile after my machine being inaccessible, the first two likes are honey trap or fakes accounts that seem to be taking the piss out of the fact I cannot access my machine.
- Taru Ann, the Finnish honey trap account, likes an old post of mine.

- Then two people like a post that is very suggestive of the situation. Zee and Luke would be references to old friends Zoe and Luke Braganza Jones from Denia.

We also, curiously, see some activity on the Cloudflare infrastructure that runs this site that shows that people in Finland are requesting pages.

## Threats

- I continue to get online threats from fake accounts.

## Sunday 8th December 2024

- There is no doubt in my mind that what I have experienced at the hands of teachers and staff at the conservatory of Denia, their friends and family, could give a person a nervous breakdown or drive them to suicide.
- I suggest investigators check all local suicide stats and untimely deaths of anyone, particular young people, who have a history of complaining about being terrorized or harassed in any way.
- I would also double check any women that may have been accused of being "hysterical" or similar when making similar gang stalking claims.
- I suggest that gang stalkers are prosecuted for attempted murder.
- I suggest that anyone found involved in poisoning or drugging is prosecuted for attempted murder.
- I suggest that anyone found involved in sexual grooming is prosecuted for sexual abuse and/or rape.
- I suggest that, where possible, the bodies of any suspicious deaths in the region are exhumed and analyzed for poisons and narcotics.
- I suggest that, all previous residents in my flat or any flat managed by anyone related to these matters, is questioned.
- And a first point of call should be Lorraine Blackbourn's family, and anyone that knew her, and to have a look at any police complaints she may have made prior to her untimely death by suicide.
- Furthermore, if I was an investigator, I'd make sure to check every single student that Domingo Cano has taught over the years to see if they ended up in porn or prostitution.
