## Conversation

- I travel to Lourdes and spend the whole summer in France up until 21st September when I return via Madrid to Denia.
- I communicate with the hacker directly in the following way:
    - I add a message to my Twitter profile.
    - He replies in the profile message of a fake account.
- I start to call him Vigas.
- I write messages like this:
    - "Vigas Vigas, put me in the movies. Oh wait, you did already."
    - "We quickly went from "I'm a lowly school teacher to I control all the women in the Marina Alta"."
    - "Vigas Vigas, is it true what they're saying, that the women of the Marina Alta have stopped locking their doors since you fell in love with me".
- A lot of it was jokes, but there was serious stuff too.
- It's a two way conversation. He tells me that he has targeted 100s of women in the region.
- I realize this is exactly what has happened to Trish and that, coupled with the fact she has a daughter and granddaughter, is why she doesn't talk.
- I see pictures on fake accounts of young and old women. I screenshot some of them.
- He's also feeding me information regarding secret filming, spiking, and drug taking.

## I realize I've been being poisoned

- It took a while but I finally realize why I got [rhabdo at class](../2023/january.md#poisoning).
- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1825575948257009675
- I start to think about my state of mind in general over the last two years.

## Hundreds of women like me

- I realize I'm one of hundreds, maybe thousands of targets.

## The trumpet teacher pics

- A bunch of account share pictures with me which look like they could be the trumpet teacher and his family.
- At least that's what I'm supposed to think, I'm not sure if it is.

## Hidden camera account

- This is related to the account that posted about [peeping at preschoolers in April](april.md#fake-account-posts-about-peeping-at-pre-schoolers).
- An account likes something I've posted in August.
- It has the same eagle trigger, and Hebrew language as the one just mentioned.
- The pinned thread on the timeline relates a person targeted by someone who he had trusted, and had sex with, and was consequently stalked and filmed by secret cameras.
- The account is here: https://x.com/Cr7Rival3711.
- The pinned message is translated here:

![hidden cameras](../../content/images/fake-accounts/hidden-cameras.png)

- I respond to this terrible tweet thread that I have just read: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1823957507728896499.
- I start to think seriously about hidden cameras in my apartment.

## Trish communication

- Trish sends WhatsApp messages which is rather unusual.
- I'm very candid with her on [WhatsApp over this period](../../evidence/whatsapps.md#trish-penny).
- I wonder if she is being asked to check up on me.
- She ignores everything I say in my messages but keeps communication open.

## Photos of abused women and girls

- At this time, I start to see a woman on fake accounts repeatedly.
- In fact, I have seen her probably for over a year.
- The pictures start innocently as if she is doing a modeling photo shoot.
- They then become her sending nudes to someone.
- They then become her masturbating in private and probably filming it on her mobile.
- They then become her involved in serious porn or prostitution.
- It was very disturbing to see this woman over and over.
- Then there were others just like her.
- The conversation I'm having with the hacker is about these women, who they are, and how appalled I am.
- They all look either that they believe they are in private, or they are drugged and surrounded by others.

## Irene

- I ask, "So who was [plate lady](../2023/july.md#plate-lady-early-in-the-month) then?".
- An answer comes, "Irena".
- I look up "Irene, ceramics artist, Valencia". 
- There she is online. Except she is about 50 now.
- The hacker sees everything I do online. We are having a real-time conversation.
- I say, "that's her isn't it?"
- The hacker responds, "nooooo". But it is undoubtedly her.
- Irene is a well known ceramics artist running her ceramics business in Onda.
- I see that the stalker pattern is to target (potentially) successful women. Is this to stop women moving forward in the world, or is it to defraud them over long periods with sexploitation material.
- The pictures of Irene that I saw in July 2023 on the `@jctot19` and `@sinremite` accounts were at least 20 years old.
- The hacker highlights another lady who may be being targeted, a sportswoman.
- I'm stunned.
- I believe I have enough evidence now.

## Time to write to people

- Given my laptop is fully accessed by hackers, I write, by hand, a letter to my friend explaining everything that's happened.
- todo: scan and add here
- I also copy and send this letter to 40+ agencies, newspapers, and well known people, all over the world.
- I do this for two reasons:
    - Justice for the good people of Denia and the Marina Alta region, especially the children, women, and girls.
    - To ensure my safety in some way because these people clearly have no intention of leaving me alone.

@todo: add letter

- Along with the letter, I send pictures that have been sent on fake accounts that may be related.

@todo: add family pics

## Followed by the gypsy in France

- There comes a point in the conversation with the hacker that feels like other people are now involved and peppered in with the conversation are threats of violence and porn references.
- An account is highlighted to me one evening via a like, and I see this extraordinarily ugly looking man on it with his daughter. It's classic fake account, just a few pics, all of him. He looks like an evil person.
- I see this guy with a woman at the baths in Cauterets.
- I see him again a couple of days later in Lourdes.
- I add a note to this effect in my handwritten letters.

## Sexual arousal

- As soon as I'm out of Denia, the intense sexual arousal drops off and then stops.

## Suspected targets

- In this section, I'll publish all the accounts I believe had pics of targets on them but please understand some may be incorrect of course.
- The hacker told me there were old and young, the British expat community was targeted often, and one older woman may have dropped down dead in October 2022.
