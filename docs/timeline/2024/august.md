## Conversation

- We have been communicating directly in the following way:
    - I add a message to my Twitter profile.
    - He replies in the profile message of a fake account.
- I call him Vigas.
- I write messages like this:
    - "Vigas Vigas, put me in the movies. Oh wait, you did already."
    - "We quickly went from "I'm a lowly school teacher to I control all the women in the Marina Alta"."
- It's a two way conversation. He tells me that he has targeted 100s of women in the region.
- I see pictures of young and old women. I screenshot some.

## Hidden camera account

!!! tip "August account with same triggers"
    - An account likes something I've posted in August.
    - It has the same eagle trigger, and Hebrew language as the one just mentioned.
    - I'm not sure if it is the same account. It could be.
    - The pinned thread on the timeline relates a person targeted by someone who he had trusted, and had sex with, and was consequently stalked and filmed by secret cameras.
    - The account is here: https://x.com/Cr7Rival3711.
    - The pinned message is translated here:

    ![hidden cameras](../../content/images/fake-accounts/hidden-cameras.png)

    - In August, I respond to this terrible tweet thread that I have just read: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1823957507728896499.

## Trish communication

## Photos of abused women and girls

- At this time, I start to see a woman I have seen from a long time repeatedly.

## Irene

- I ask, "So who was plate lady then?".
- An answer comes, "Irene".
- I look up "Irene, ceramics artist, Valencia"
- There she is. Except she is about 50 now.
- Irene is a well known ceramics artist with a good business in Onda.
- They also go for the successful women.
- The pictures of Irene that I saw last July on the `@jctot19` and `@sinremite` accounts were at least 20 years old.
- I'm stunned.
- I have enough now.

## Time to write to people

- Given my laptop is fully accessed by hackers, I write, by hand, a letter to my friend explaining everything that's happened.
- todo: scan and add here
- I also send this letter to 30+ agencies, newspapers, well know people, all over the world.
- I do this for two reasons:
    - Justice for the good people of Denia and the Marina Alta region, especially the children, women, and girls.
    - To ensure my safety in some way because these people clearly have no intention of leaving me alone.

## Followed by the gypsy in France

- I see this guy I saw on Twitter at the baths.
- I add a note to this effect in my handwritten letters.
