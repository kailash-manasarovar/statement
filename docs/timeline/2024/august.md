## Sexual arousal

- As soon as I'm out of Denia, the intensity of the sexual arousal drops off and then stops.

## Conversation with the hacker

- I travel to Lourdes and spend the whole summer in France up until 21st September when I return via Madrid to Denia.
- I communicate with the hacker directly in the following way:
    - I add a message to my Twitter profile.
    - He replies in the profile message of a fake account.
- I start to call him Vigas.

!!! info
    - The name Vigas comes from the [beams interaction in May](may.md#beams).
    - I believe this is the trumpet teachers' nickname as he has big legs.
    - Vigas is the word for wooden beams in Spanish.

- I write messages like this:
    - "Vigas Vigas, put me in the movies. Oh wait, you did already."
    - "How quickly we went from 'I'm a lowly school teacher to I control all the women in the Marina Alta'."
    - "Vigas Vigas, is it true what they're saying, that the women of the Marina Alta have stopped locking their doors since you fell in love with me".
- A lot of it was jokes, but there was serious stuff too.
- It's a two way conversation. 
- He tells me that he has targeted 100s of women in the region and starts sending pictures of some of them.
- I realize this is exactly what has happened to Trish and, coupled with the fact she has a daughter and granddaughter, this is why she doesn't talk.
- I see pictures on fake accounts of young and old women. I screenshot some of them.
- He's also feeding me information regarding secret filming, spiking, and drug taking.

## I realize I have been poisoned and drugged

- It took a while but I finally realize why I got [rhabdo at class](../2023/january.md#poisoning).
- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1825575948257009675
- I start to think about my state of mind in general over the last two years.
- It's all getting clear in my mind finally.

## Hundreds of women like me

- I realize I'm one of hundreds, maybe thousands of targets.
- Women and girls lured into relationships that don't exist with the intention of blackmail and exploitation, or silencing.

## The trumpet teacher pics

- He sends interactions with accounts that have pictures that could be the trumpet teacher and his family from a long while back.

![family](../../content/images/fake-accounts/family/Vigas%20dad.png)
![family](../../content/images/fake-accounts/family/son.JPG)

- At least that's what I'm supposed to think, I'm not entirely sure if these are genuine pics or not.
- However, I am delighted to receive them and I feel again a strong personal connection with whoever it is I'm communicating with.
- These pics, coupled with the pics of the two boys make me feel like I have a collection of personal pics sent by the trumpet teacher. 
- I also have the strange sensation the brother (possible twin) is called Andre.

## Hidden camera account

- One morning, I wake up and I see an account that has liked one of my posts from the night before.
- It has an eagle as profile pic. The same eagle profile pic on the account that posted about [peeping at preschoolers in April](april.md#fake-account-posts-about-peeping-at-pre-schoolers).
- The account writes in the Hebrew language and I translate the pinned post.
- The post details being targeted by someone who he had trusted, and had sex with, and was consequently stalked and filmed by secret cameras.
- The account is here: https://x.com/Cr7Rival3711.
- The pinned message is translated here:

![hidden cameras](../../content/images/fake-accounts/hidden-cameras.png)

- I respond to this terrible tweet thread that I have just read: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1823957507728896499.
- I start to think seriously about the possibility of hidden cameras in my apartment.

## Trish communication

- Trish sends me WhatsApp messages which are rather unusual.
- I'm very candid with her on [WhatsApp over this period](../../evidence/whatsapps.md#trish-penny).
- I wonder if she is being asked to check up on me.
- She ignores everything I say in my messages but keeps communicating with me.
- I assume she is not allowed to make comments on anything I have said.
- It is very sinister.

## Photos of abused women and girls

- At this time, I start to see a woman on fake accounts repeatedly.
- In fact, I have seen her probably for over a year, I think the earliest pic I have of her is from April this year but I was receiving them for a much longer time.
- The pictures start innocently as if she is doing a modeling photo shoot.

![photo shoot](../../content/images/targeted-women/innocent-lady/1.png)
![photo shoot](../../content/images/targeted-women/innocent-lady/2.png)

- They then appear to become her privately sending nudes to someone, these private pics escalating into sexual activity.

![photo shoot](../../content/images/targeted-women/innocent-lady/2.1.png)
![photo shoot](../../content/images/targeted-women/innocent-lady/2.2.png)
![photo shoot](../../content/images/targeted-women/innocent-lady/2.5.png)
![photo shoot](../../content/images/targeted-women/innocent-lady/3.png)

- They then become her masturbating in private and probably filming it on her mobile. I deleted this one but kept a screenshot of the account where it showed up.

![photo shoot](../../content/images/targeted-women/innocent-lady/3.5.png)

- They then become her involved in serious porn or prostitution.

![photo shoot](../../content/images/targeted-women/innocent-lady/6.png)
![photo shoot](../../content/images/targeted-women/innocent-lady/7.png)

- It was very disturbing to see this woman over and over. And this is only a small selection of the images I saw of her.
- There were other women just like this too, going from privately sending nudes to clearly ending up in porn, likely violent.
- The conversation I'm having with the hacker is about these women, who they are, and how appalled I am.
- They all look either that they believe they are in private, or they are drugged and in situations it is not clear they would agree to if they were in their right minds. 

## Irene

- We're clearly having a very intimate conversation about some very dark matters.
- I ask, "So who was [plate lady](../2023/july.md#plate-lady-early-in-the-month) then?".
- An answer comes immediately, "Irene".
- I look up on Google "Irene, ceramics artist, Valencia". 
- There she is online. Except she is about 50 now: https://alfarim.es/coneix-nos. Irene Molina Pascual.
- There is no doubt. This is the woman I saw as a 30 year old in pics posted and manipulated for me to see via Google search in July 2023 when searching with the `@jctot19` and `@sinremite` accounts.
- I am amazed!
- Remember that the hacker at this stage is watching everything I do online in real time. We are having a real-time conversation.
- I say, "that's her isn't it?"
- The hacker responds, "nooooo". But it is undoubtedly her.
- Irene is a well known ceramics artist running her ceramics business in Onda in the Valencia region.
- I realize that the stalker pattern is to target (potentially) successful women. Is this to stop women moving forward in the world, or is it to defraud them over long periods with sexploitation material?
- The pictures of Irene that I saw in July 2023 on the `@jctot19` and `@sinremite` accounts were at least 20 years old.
- The hacker highlights another lady who may be being targeted, a sportswoman in Castellon, Lidia Sanchez Puebla.
- I'm stunned.
- I believe I have enough evidence to share and it's my responsibility to share it.

## Time to write to people

- Given my laptop is fully accessed by hackers, I write, painstakingly by hand, a letter to my friend explaining everything that's happened.

    - [The handwritten letter explaining what's going on](../../content/documents/letters/scanned-hand-written-letter.pdf).

- I also copy and send this letter to 40+ agencies, newspapers, and well known people, all over the world.
- I do this for two reasons:
    - Justice for the good people of Denia and the Marina Alta region; especially the children, women, and girls.
    - To ensure my safety in some way because these people clearly have no intention of leaving me alone.
- Along with the letter, I send some of the pictures that have been sent on fake accounts that may be related. I send all the [trumpet teacher pics](#the-trumpet-teacher-pics). 
- I also send pics of Rocio Vidal who I believe has been targeted as I mentioned seeing her on the bed about to take her clothes off.

![Rocio Vidal](../../content/images/Rocio-Vidal-on-Google-search.png)

- I also send a copy of the first page of my [denuncia from March](march.md#reporting-the-matter-to-the-police-in-madrid).
- The conversation with the hacker continues as I do this.

## Followed by the gypsy in France

- There comes a point in the conversation with the hacker over this time that feels like other people are now involved.
- Peppered into the conversation are threats of violence and porn references.
- This has always been the pattern. Communication starts in a way which seems relatively private. Then there seems to be other voices involved. And finally there is some shocking threat of violence or similar and communication breaks down. This is the pattern from:
    - April to June 2023 while conversing over Twitter.
    - June to August 2023 while conversing over Twitter.
    - Then the pattern repeats with fake account activity, such as the American account Matthew, the account from Madrid at Christmas, Beams, HierEncore, etc.
- So the same pattern has started to develop now within this conversation we have been having about targeted women over the years.
- An account likes one of my posts one evening, and I see this extraordinarily ugly looking man on it with his daughter. It's classic fake account, just a few pics, all of him, but he looks like an evil person.
- A few days later, I see this exact same guy with a woman at the baths in Cauterets while I'm there. I'm shocked.
- I see him again a couple of days later in Lourdes.
- I add a note to this effect in my handwritten letter which you will see at the back on page 21 and 22.

## Suspected targets 

- In this section, I'll publish all the accounts I believe had pics of targets on them but please understand some may be incorrect due to the nature of the conversation.
- The hacker told me there were old and young, the British expat community was targeted often, and he suggested one older woman may have dropped down dead in October 2022.
- He stated he loved every one of them!
- Some of these I believe are illicit and the subject doesn't know she is being photographed at this point. I believe these to be the "when she finds out" content.
