# October 2024

## Poison warnings

- I start to see references (warnings?) about poisoning.
- The reference to gay men and muscle men here makes me think of Domingo.

![referencing poison](../../content/images/targeted-women/car-woman/7.png)
![translation](../../content/images/translated-poison.png)
![translation](../../content/images/poison-translation.png)

- The message says: "Enjoy my homemade poison. The poison made by my own family..".

## YouTube with Kelly Oliver Dougall

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYsj4OgiYA
- Sending it to my landlady on WhatsApp.
- She *slow claps* back.

## Bullying at Polygon

!!! tip "In retrospect"
    - I wonder if Polygon's role from the porn-gang perspective - apart from financial and operational - was to add even more *bullying* alibi they could use to destabilize me and, if they needed to, charge me with hysteria or a vivid imagination, or whatever they do when they do it all together against one woman's complaints.
    - This makes even more sense given I had no choice but to leave the conservatory in fear for my life and so they could not be used anymore as alibi for elaborate claims.

- Polygon are more obviously building up to firing me.
- Colleagues' demeanor towards me in [Bali](may.md#bali) really solidified what had been going on since the previous November.
- I request an investigation done with regards to being targeted continually for my [women's rights activism](june.md#uk).
- I don't realize that I've been targeted because of the [porn fatwa](../early-years/2003.md#porn-fatwa) which has gotten totally out of control; my women's rights activities are an extra gift for them I expect.
- The HR team has a company-wide meeting in which they mention me specifically in a underhand way.
- James Dawes (ex-colleague of [Hans Bodani](../2023/november.md#polygon)) leads the meeting and alludes to something exciting coming up.
- He starts to mention the word [Fetch](../early-years/interim.md#fetchai) over and over for no particular reason.
- "Remember", the HR woman who takes over says laughing, (incidentally the same woman I'm reporting bullying to), "Remember the word Fetch".
- Fetch is a direct reference to when [I was working at a company in Cambridge and a man flashed at me in an online meeting](../early-years/interim.md#fetchai).
- HR professionals share stories like these so that women will eventually be driven out of tech for good. They've very nearly achieved this goal.
- Gabriel Silva makes sure to mention we *must* all watch this meeting if we didn't attend, especially me.
- Polygon hires a [man who targeted me at zkSync](../2023/june.md#work-stress), Coogan.
- I guess there are so few technical female-workers in the industry, you're bound to be targeted by the wider community.
- I wonder if James Dawes and the HR team had seen me [starring in child rape-gang porn](../2023/november.md#first-time-they-flash-up-my-naked-16-year-old-body-on-x) too?

## Is there a bible in the house?

- I start to see continued X posts that refer to whether there is a "bible in the house".
- This is usually written as a question.
- I bought a bible during this time.
- I believe someone was trying to warn me that the poison dose was going up and murder was the intention. Hence, a bible in the house for the priest to perform the last rights.
- These posts were in English and Spanish sometimes too.

## Activity in apartment number 18 next door

- The next door apartment is barely used. I've heard people in there maybe twice for no more than a week in nearly three years.
- There may have been people there for the summer holidays, while I was away, so I never thought it odd.
- Whenever my neighbor Marie Carmen, or Pedro the caretaker, referred to the people at number 18, it was always in a derogatory way, with a turned up nose, as if there was something not good about them.
- However, from the moment I arrive back in Dénia at the end of September 2024, there is a lot of activity in this apartment. People coming and going at all times. People talking loudly at night.
- I saw a slim woman with shortish dark curly hair, of about 60 years old, going in and out every day nearly.
- One night, I hear a woman say in Spanish, loudly enough for me to hear, "and nothing was ever good enough for her", and I presumed she was referring to me. 
- I guess that this is the main lie the people of Dénia have been told about me and why they all support the gang stalkers and join in if they're so inclined. The foreign woman who thought nothing was good enough in Dénia, which is as far from the truth as possible.
- They only needed a couple of people who I had contentious interactions with over the years to support that. 
- One of those could possibly be my neighbor from Cami Llavador, Charo, who really didn't like me at all.
- Another could be a woman Magpie I had been friends with years ago in 2006, someone who got extremely angry with me one afternoon after I said something rather innocuous yet truthful, something she found extremely hurtful.
- I guess manipulating a whole town to hate someone can be really easy.

## Iceland

- I pop to Iceland in Benissa to get some British products.
- I wear my mask.
- I'm served at the till by a nice-looking blond woman who smiles at me like I'm an idiot.
- When I get home, on X, I see a fake account with with the woman in it.
- She is sitting on a balcony wall somewhere in the Marina Alta region with a view of the sea and mountains.
- She is wearing a man's shirt.

## Saturday 5th October

- I go for a walk along Las Rotas.
- I take my analog phone so I'm not tracked and followed.
- I'm tracked and followed.
- Just before the restaurant Sendra, Carmen Cano passes me on a bike, u-turns abruptly and stops to stare at me, grins and cycles off.
- I have this on camera.
- I tweet about this later on and it is translated a lot.

![seeing carmen](../../content/images/seeing-carmen.png)

## Sunday 6th October

- I go for a walk along Las Marinas beach in the afternoon.
- I am followed by older men the whole way along, men in their 50s and 60s.
- On the way back home a couple starts walking in front of me.
- The woman on the left is someone I've seen on a Twitter fake account and I had a screenshot of this prior to losing access to my machine on 1st December. She has quite a masculine body.
- She has the same tattoo as the [innocent lady who gets into porn](august.md#photos-of-abused-women-and-girls) on her arm and she takes pains to show me.
- The man on her right smiles and shows me his face. He looks like a possum.
- I have this on camera.
- I never go to the beach again.
- At the laundry that evening, the lovely man there asks, without requiring an answer "¿Todo claro?". 
- I mention this in [another section about the laundry](../2023/november.md#the-laundry).
- Back home that night a fake account says possum man is looking for developers. The inference is I'm being offered a job in tech.

!!! warning
    - Something I realize now is that throughout the intense cyber stalking period, I would say September 2023 to May 2024, accounts about possums would regularly pop up on my Twitter feed; e.g. a possum of the day account came up regularly for ages.
    - Like other accounts I saw with great regularity, violence and porn specifically, I never followed any of these accounts and it never made any sense for me to see them.

- I do not know what any of this means. Is it more tricks to scare me? Why would they put so much effort into it. I don't understand. The whole thing makes no sense.
- And how is anyone supposed to know what's going on if no one ever talks to you and if they can only lie anyway?

## Job offer

- The following day I'm contacted on LinkedIn by a yacht company based in Altea with a job offer which I refuse because I'm certain it's a scam.

## Bumping into Paul again

- On 6th October, on my way to the Indian restaurant, I bump into Paul who is having a beer at the Open 24 Market at Plaza Benidorm, the usual place I "bump" into him.
- He's clearly been asked to check up on me.
- We chat a bit. I tell him I'm thinking about running women's rights activities in Dénia.
- There is a lot unsaid. 
- The last time I spoke to him, in the same spot probably sometime in July, I mentioned that I was willing to pay EUR 500 for copies of the hacked sexual videos.
- He had mentioned another guy at that time, an English man, being very popular with everyone, all the girls coming up to him and saying hello as if they knew him.
- I wasn't sure how this related to what I'd just said.
- I mentioned Halloween was coming up and did he think we should go out again. I said I would WhatsApp Alex about it.
- I did. She didn't reply.
- On Halloween I text the following:

![WhatsApp to Alex](../../content/whatsapps/whatsapp-to-alex.png)

- There's no reply.

## Threats and a woman at the laundry

- Whenever I go to the laundry, there is some stalker activity or another.
- This has been true since they started to drug me back in December 2022.
- I mention this in more detail in the [November 2023 section](../2023/november.md#the-laundry).
- Of course, they know where I'm going and what I'm doing so they can spring into action whenever they like.
- On two occasions in October, threatening young men are in the laundry while I'm there. 
- The first time, a small group of young men are speaking about 4 or 5 different languages. 
- The second time, a group stares at me menacingly. I stare right on back.

### The woman

- The second time, I see a woman chatting with the lovely man there who manages the laundry.
- I know her, but I cannot think how.
- She looks at me, our eyes meet. I smile.
- I have no idea how I know her but I do.
- I now wonder if she is a member of the Hospitalite de Lourdes, and does service at the baths, like myself.
- Could that be where I know her from?
- Did I work with her one session in one of the baths sometime between 2014-2018?
- TBC.

## Rape porn gangs

- I tweet about my suspicions about what is going on: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1845101018746343666, and include some fake accounts to describe what I'm seeing.

### We take what we want

- An aggressive message flies by "we take what we want", and the arrogant statement "we're hunters" flies by continuously.
- The implication is that older men I saw on the beach do whatever they like to women and children in Denia.
- Except, it turns out, they have to sedate us first.
- [So, aka Janet, my election volunteer](../2024/june.md#volunteers-not-what-they-seem), posts a random line on X; "Hunters".
- I'm starting to see what's going on but it's difficult to think straight as I'm constantly drugged with something I'm ingesting in my apartment, or breathing in perhaps through the vents.

### Porn star outside my house

- I come home from the shop.
- There is an outrageously dressed porn-star looking woman sitting on the bench outside my apartment building.
- I mean dressed ridiculously for a Tuesday evening, or whenever it was.
- Absolutely like a porn star.
- At the time I thought it was weird.
- Now I wonder were they bringing people like this into my apartment while they were sedating and assaulting me to spice up the shows; and showing me them too (also probably filmed).
- I now wonder about the [upstairs neighbor and what I thought was his daughter in the lift](../2022/march.md#upstairs-neighbor-at-carrer-furs); a meeting obviously timed as they knew where I was every second.
- I guess it could have been another porn "actress" come to star with me in the weekly specials on Denia TV or wherever they were being shown to literally everyone and anyone in the world.

## VSSH collects his aware at the Palau d'Arts

- The L'Amistat band are awarded the *best band in the Valencian region*.
- Extraordinary given every knows what's going on.

## Fatima 20-26th October

- I head to Madrid on 19th October to stay one night before traveling to Fatima in Portugal. I need to be away from Dénia as much as possible for my nervous system.

!!! warning "Why didn't you leave Dénia?"
    - If I leave, then the story gets buried, the police do not investigate, and it happens again and again, and maybe someone is driven, again?, to suicide, or maybe they, again?, murder someone with poison, and children, again?, could be groomed into goodness knows what.
    - I felt a sense of obligation to the vulnerable and I've been waiting for my intuition to tell me what to do.
    - I was always working so hard, I had to think about that above and beyond everything else.
    - It was never clear where I could go to either. I still don't know. My family home in London is non-optimal.

- Just before I leave on Saturday 19th October, I empty the bins. 
- There is a man in the driver's seat of a car staring at me angrily. 
- His wife is embarrassed and looking down in the passenger seat. 
- They look familiar, and I think they might be part of the Denia TV crowd I've seen online.
- I remain amazed that anyone could be angry at the person they have been terrorizing relentlessly. I guess it's guilt. I tweet about it and suggest the man, if he didn't like the porn of me masturbating that everyone has seen, he should take it up with the local porn technicians.
- I tweet about it: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1847579824128139602.
- As I'm driving to the hotel I've booked in Madrid, all of a sudden, the volume disappears on Google maps so I'm lost on the busy M30/M40 junctions.
- When I stop, it's impossible to see how to fix this, and I try every permutation of getting the Google voice to come back. Nothing works.
- When I arrive in Fatima the following evening, even though my iPhone camera is blocked, I get notifications on fake accounts of items in my hotel room. Of course, only the camera facing me is blocked, not the one looking out.

### Madrid

- I see [my friend](../2024/march/13-end.md#madrid) again and explain how much danger I am in.
- She tells me she knows someone who can help me; a lady who works for the Spanish foreign office in London.
- My friend says she can visit Madrid the following week as I'm passing through on my way home and talk to her.

## The router malfunctions while I'm in Fatima

- On Tuesday 22nd October around 11am, my router at home malfunctions.

![camera offline](../../content/images/camera-offline.JPG){width=55%}

- My home security camera is unavailable.
- I wonder if my home was accessed over the few days before I returned.

!!! danger
    - Given the next week's experience with my health, and the ongoing health problems over the next months, including declining eyesight and a diagnosis of PACS, I believe it is highly likely Domingo the piano teacher's family or associates accessed my home and were able to apply poison to food and even toiletries that I have taken with me.

- Here is the [WhatsApp chat with Movistar](../../content/whatsapps/WhatsApp%20Chat%20with%20Movistar.zip) where I explain I have been hacked and ask them to investigate.

## Intense online stalking and hacking

- Hackers post pictures of my hotel room seen from the front camera of my phone.
- There is constant X activity.
- tbc.

## Polygon fires the whole writing team

- I'm fired summarily on 25th October, [as expected](#bullying-at-polygon).
- The constant dehumanizing up to now didn't work so they had to think of something more formal.
- I'm buzzed into a meeting with HR.
- Gabriel Silva reads from a script with Jonathan the HR guy standing beside him.
- Gabe is very *very* nervous. His voice is shaking. He looks terrified.
- Jonathan is extremely aggressive with me when I try to talk to them.
- I'm told the whole team is dismissed as they are no longer required.
- I used to think it was because of my anti-woke, women's rights activities and the extraordinary manner in which an industrial spy was able to cause enormous trouble with the tech systems, and consequently find out about my private political activities and manage to stick the boot in for me, just weeks after I started.
- I now believe this was incorrect, and it was instead due to the [porn fatwa](../early-years/2003.md#porn-fatwa) which had gotten so out of control everything I did in my life was monitored and manipulated by porn addicts, often working alongside me in tech companies.
- I had just given a public online interview stating I believed I was being drugged and filmed in my flat.
- Furthermore, anyone in Polygon management knowing what was happening to me in Denia will have known I was about to be [murdered by poisoning by Carmen Cano and her associates](#serious-poisoning-with-intent-to-harm-or-kill). 
- They couldn't have me turn up to meetings while that was happening now, could they?
- Did Gabriel know what was coming next for me?
- I wonder if VSSH and the L'Amistat band were also aware of this about to happen.
- The dismissal letter explains the company is aware it is an unlawful dismissal, but I'm supposed to accept it.
- I instruct a lawyer to help me who appears to be on Polygon's side.
- I suspect they continue to hire one of my team, [Hansraj Bodani](../2023/november.md#polygon); a man who was outrageously insubordinate towards me when I was his manager.
- The other member of my team, Anthony, is given work with one of Polygon's strong partners, `gateway.fm`, but doesn't stay long (maybe they found out what I was saying was true).
- Hans appeared to have been instructed to be insubordinate towards me (possibly by James Dawes who he had worked with before, or more like directly from Gabriel Silva and the founders).
- His behavior included shouting me down in meetings, constant heckling, not doing any work at all, complaining about me to my manager, and more.
- Whenever I asked for help from my managers with him, I was ignored.
- Hans clearly knew he could say and do whatever he liked, and he did so.
- Hans was good as gold with Gabriel Silva when he took over.
- I suspect he's working there now still.
- Polygon, and other human resources agents and companies, are beginning to look very suspect.

## Couple in hotel room

- Fake accounts post profile pics of couples in hotels rooms.
- I see a young Spanish couple lying down together.
- I know it is a hotel room as the furniture is sparse and the hotel style is very familiar to me.
- I'll see if I can dig this up.

## Madrid and Paloma

- My friend and I meet Paloma; she has flown in from London where she works at the Spanish foreign office or similar.
- There is a lot of talk about how secure her phone is, and how it can pick up any sort of hacking interference and shutdown the whole network in a building.
- Paloma doesn't really listen to me when I speak, she talks directly to my friend.
- I tell her about [Irene](august.md#irene-the-plate-lady), about [Rocio Vidal](../2023/october.md#rocio-vidal), about the hundreds of other women.
- I have to push to be heard; although she sort of groans at every new horror I mention, as if none of this is unfamiliar to her.
- She doesn't seem to be interested in what I have to say, until one moment when I mention that the trumpet teacher's daughters might be threatened with kidnap if he didn't do what they say.
- At that moment, her eyes light up and she says, oh we can do something with that.
- I'm dismayed.
- A woman can go through years of torture and no-one cares, and the minute a man, someone essentially involved in creating this hell is in trouble, they'll spring into action.
- It feels like industrial woman-hating and accepted sexual grooming of minors.
- Her words suggest thousands of ignored complaints.
- She looks at her phone and says, oh, yes, Rocio Vidal was hacked.
- I then tell her about Hazel and Sandra Smith and how I have known who and what they are since 2006, about how they've been free to target the ex-pat elderly, and how they targeted me at that time.
- My friend remembers me mentioning them in 2007. I told her that I had seen British criminals in the Marina Alta, Las Marinas to be precise.

!!! tip "A curiousity"
    - Isn't it curious I never told anyone about Hazel. Or other extraordinary things I knew about too. And they managed to get me run out of town with the lie that I'm a grass. Most marvelous karma kicking in, isn't it...

- I tell her about the [innocent lady groomed into porn](august.md#photos-of-abused-women-and-girls) and the [sedated woman in the car](september.md#another-upsetting-targeted-woman), and the many pictures I received that I believe are targeted women, including [a picture of one of Domingo's students](../2023/october.md#choir) Elsa.
- Paloma looks briefly at my friend and says my story sounds like devil worship.
- I'm even more dismayed. I know what this means.
- I know she's not going to help me and she will be looking at covering it all up first and foremost.
- She does say, it sounds like a chaos doesn't it, to my friend.
- She advises I write a timeline down.
- She tells me she can help me, maybe get Interpol involved.
- She says once we have the information, then we can help [Irene](august.md#irene-the-plate-lady) and the other targeted women.
- I hug her and thank her, but I don't expect to see or hear from her again.
- Over the next few weeks, accounts fly by with names like "dubious government official", and similar.
- They know.
- When I see my friend again, she tells me Paloma thinks we are both in danger.
- She also tells me that Paloma had looked Vidal SASTRE SANCHEZ HORNERO in the Generalitat systems and found not record of a man with that name.
- Curiously, at the same time, someone called Vidal SASTRE SANCHEZ HORNERO is [picking up a prize at the Palau de Arts in Valencia](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#the-lamistat-quart-band).
- I have to wonder if Paloma or her superiors gave the OK for my immediate dispatching, Denia poisoners informed immediately they can do what they want to me?
- Is that why Carmen Cano, et al, were so utterly unconcerned about being seen while they tampered with my water pipes or entered my apartment, and seemed indeed to want me to see and hear them, and know about their vile intentions. 
- Had Paloma decided I knew too much already?
- Are the school-board supported sex offenders and murderers protected from the very top? Well that's an obvious answer isn't it.

## Serious poisoning with intent to harm or kill

- I arrive back in Dénia on 27th October.
- The DANA hits the Valencian region.
- On waking up on Monday 28th October, I have an inexplicable and excruciating headache at home which lasts a couple of days. 
- While sitting at my desk, on the Monday morning, drinking my coffee, I experience shooting nerve pains all over my face.
- My kidneys start to really ache over the week; the dull aching gets worse and worse, left and right and starts that screaming pain thing.

!!! info "Pain in kidneys"
    - I have experienced pain like this (although not as intense) continuously while I'm in my flat in Dénia since, probably, January 2023.
    - I can describe it as a dull backache at my kidney area on the right and left side that starts about midday and gets worse until I have to lie down for a bit.

- My urine becomes extremely frothy and it was fine the week before in Fatima.

![Frothy urine](../../content/images/frothy%20urine.png)

- I really feel like I'm being poisoned over this week in my flat, and quite intensely too.
- Someone wants me to get seriously sick and/or possibly die.
- If my dad did not have an accident on the 1st of November, and I had to rush back to London, I believe that Domingo's family may have made good on their threats and killed me via poisoning.
- I believe everyone knew this was planned and intended; the [angry man and his wife in his car as I'm leaving for Fatima](#fatima-20-26th-october), the [L'Amistat band](#vssh-collects-his-aware-at-the-palau-darts) who may be offering some sort of alibi, even my bosses at [Polygon](#polygon-fires-the-whole-writing-team) who clearly only intended to fire me for dubious reasons.
- How did everyone know? Is that part of the porn-soap-opera too? Did the audience have constant access to my home cameras and see people come in and interfere with my bathroom products?
- I take some samples of water and items related to the air vents to London in the hope that the police will one day find things serious enough to investigate and I will have evidence for them to analyze.
- There is another warning and condemnation about poisoning given via a fake account on Halloween night, the 1st November.

![doctor pic](../../content/images/doctor-1.png)
![doctor pic](../../content/images/doctor-2.png)

- That day, Friday 1st November, in the afternoon, I'm certain I see Carmen Cano and the woman I have seen going in and out of number 18 leaving the building together. They smile at me as I walk by.

### Mary breaks

- On one evening over these few days before I left for London, I had my little statue of Mary in my hand and it was if she jumped out and onto the floor, smashing into pieces.
- A sign, but not for me.

## Challenging Sandra Rita Diaz

- I have a WhatsApp chat with Sandra.
- I explain to her I was sacked and she starts writing a genuine and rather horrible curse on the man who sacked me; I have to tell her to calm down.
- She's been gaslighting me for a while too.
- I'm now suddenly sure she's fully involved.
- Her words sound exactly like Carmen Cano is talking to me; the words of an evil person.
- I tell her what I think.
- She says, no Katharine, I am your friend.
- I say no, you're involved aren't you Sandra.
- You work for the police. 
- No, no, I don't work for the police, she says. I don't know why she would deny her actual job is working for the police.
- Yes, you do.
- You kept "popping" up, I say. You have a boyfriend at the border between Spain and Portugal.
- I say, yes, you're involved, aren't you.
- I never hear from her again.

## Nota simple from the neighbors flats

- I'm trying to figure out how they're poisoning me.
- My kitchen, where the water from the mains comes in that I use in tea, coffee, cooking, etc (I never drink it without boiling first) backs onto Marie Carmen's flat, number 16, and there is a big wardrobe in her flat against the joining wall.

!!! danger
    - There is a weird mechanism I always thought strange under the sink where a small plastic extremely dirty pipe comes out and into the water pipe.

!!! danger "Alert, something I just remembered"
    - I remember being in my flat, at work or relaxing, and hearing the water pipes in the kitchen squeaking as if they were moving around.
    - This was during 2022 and 2023, maybe once in 2024.
    - I remember thinking it must have been cockroaches under the sink walking on the water pipe (which is like a hose) and I would go to check and see nothing.
    - I wonder now was Marie Carmen, or someone else, accessing my water pipes from her flat somehow?
    - Another weird sound was a short puff of air I would hear on a regular basis. I thought it was the hot water boiler. Now I'm not so sure.

- Is there some mechanism to access the apartment's drinking water in Marie Carmen's flat?
- I get the paperwork for the flat on the other side, number 18. This apartment backs onto my bedroom and bathroom wall.
    - [Nota simple number 18](../../content/documents/evidence/number%2018%20beside%20me%20bedroom%20wall.pdf).
- And I get the paperwork for the flat above mine, number 23.
    - [Note simple number 23](../../content/documents/evidence/number%2023%20upstairs.pdf).

## Trying to find the cameras

- I'm absolutely sure there are cameras in my flat but they are impossible to find.
- Nevertheless I believe there is one on the ceiling in the living room above the TV; I always noticed a little black dot there.
- I believe there is one on the ceiling in the corner of the bedroom which matches the position of the spy-cam porn posted on my Google search results.
- There is a huge purposeful hole in the wall behind the bathroom mirror also, however.
- There is another one behind the sofa on the wall.
- I'm interested in one particular network I can see on the networks around: **Casa LANister**.

![Available networks](../../content/images/lan.png)

- I'm also very interested in the group of networked devices named **Cascadas** which I believe are the hidden cameras but only an investigative team would be able to confirm this.
- When the man from Telco comes to [fix the router](#the-router-malfunctions-while-im-in-fatima), he has obviously been told to tell me about the spy-cam LAN.
- He asks me to come over to where he is standing, which is underneath where I believe there's a spy-cam and in front of the TV.
- He starts talking about something particularly inconsequential, and while he's doing so he's pointing at the *Casa LANister* connections very slowly, and very pointedly, and looking at me meaningfully as he does while mumbling about something completely irrelevant.

## The police trafficking email

- I send a mail to the `trata@policia.es` email, an anonymous email where I'm told I can send information safely.
- [The email and responses](../../content/documents/emails/trata@policia.pdf).
- I get a response from Dénia police who were [decidedly unhelpful in February](february.md#my-first-trip-to-the-spanish-police-in-denia).
- I do not respond.

## Mercadona

- The last time I visit Mercadona, probably the last week of October just before I leave, I am mass-harassed.
- A woman is pointing and laughing at me.
- People are giving me weird looks.
- The checkout lady looks like the sister of [the second and a half man, Mark](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#mark-from-english-class-in-2013).
- As I leave the store, the door is shut and won't open.
- I'm pressing the button and they've put the word "pervert" on the LED.
- I hear laughing.
- I find it ridiculous. It's supposed to terrify me.
- Could the whole of Denia know I was a switcheroo porn target, and need to be rid of me because the next batch of targets needs attending to?

## Silvia

- The hackers imply that Silvia is the trumpet teacher's daughter and post pictures of a child who is supposed to be her.
- The implication is that the trumpet teacher had a drug debt that he couldn't pay off and the pornographers had threatened to target his daughter Silvia.
- In order to avoid this, the trumpet teacher had agreed to target and drug me at the conservatory of Dénia.
