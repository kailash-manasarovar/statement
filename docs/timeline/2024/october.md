## Activity in apartment number 18 next door

- The next door apartment is barely used. I've heard people in there maybe twice for no more than a week in nearly three years.
- There may have been people there for the summers while I was away so I didn't think it odd.
- From when I arrive back in Denia, there is a lot of activity in this apartment. People coming and going at all times. People talking loudly at night.
- One night, I hear a woman say in Spanish, "and nothing was ever good enough for her", and I presumed she was referring to me.

## Bump into Paul again

- On 6th October, my way to the Indian restaurant, I bump into Paul who is having a beer at the Open 24 Market at Plaza Benidorm, the usual place I "bump" into him.
- We chat a bit, I tell him I'm thinking about running women's rights activities in Denia.
- There is a lot unsaid as the last time I spoke to him, in the same spot, I mentioned that I was willing to pay EUR 500 for copies of the hacked sexual videos.
- I mentioned Halloween was coming up and did he think we should go out again. I said I would WhatsApp Alex about it.
- I did. She didn't reply.
- On Halloween I text the following:

- There's no reply.

## Threats at the laundry



## Fatima

- I head to Madrid to stay one night before moving onto Fatima in Portugal. I need to be away from Denia as much as possible for my nervous system.

!!! warning "Why didn't you leave?"
    - If I leave, then the story gets buried, the police do not investigate, and it happens again and again, and maybe someone is driven, again?, to suicide, or maybe they, again?, murder someone with poison.

- As I'm driving to the hotel I've booked in Madrid, all of a sudden, the volume disappears on Google maps so I'm lost on the busy M30/M40 junctions.
- When I stop, it's impossible to see how to fix this, and I try every permutation of getting the Google voice to come back. Nothing works.
- Even though my iPhone camera is blocked, I get notifications on fake accounts of items in my hotel room. Of course, only the camera facing me is blocked, not the one looking out.

## Serious poisoning with intent to harm or kill

- I travel to Fatima in Portugal over 19th - 27th October.
- On Friday 25th October, in Fatima, I'm made redundant from my job.
- I arrive back in Denia on 27th October.
- On Monday 28th October, I get an excruciating headache at home. 
- While sitting at my desk, drinking my coffee, I experience shooting nerve pains all over my face.
- My kidneys start to ache over the week; it gets worse and worse.
- My urine becomes extremely frothy and it was fine the week before in Fatima.

- I feel like I'm being poisoned over this week in my flat, and quite intensely.
- Someone wants me to get sick or possibly die.
- If mny dad did not have an accident on the 1st of November and I had to rush back to London, I believe that Domingo's family may have made good on their threats and killed me via poisoning.
- I take some samples of water and items related to the air vents to London in the hope that the police will one day find things serious enough to investigate and I will have evidence for them to analyze.
- There is a [warning and condemnation about poisoning given via a fake account](august.md#i-realize-i-have-been-poisoned-and-drugged) on Halloween night, the 1st November.
- That day, Friday 1st November, I'm certain I see Carmen Cano and another woman (a woman I have seen going in and out of number 18) together leaving the building. They smile at me as I walk by.

## Trying to find the cameras

- I'm absolutely sure there are cameras in my flat but they are impossible to find.
- There is a huge hole in the wall behind the bathroom mirror, however.
- I'm interested in one particular network I can see on the networks around: **Casa LANister**.

- I'm also very interested in the group of networked devices named **Cascadas** which I believe are the hidden cameras but only an investigative team would be able to confirm this.
