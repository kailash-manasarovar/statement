## Inspector from the Generalitat 

- I arrive at piano class on March 5th and all of a sudden a woman enters the class
- Paqui explains she is here to help me
- I am delighted and ask her why the GV have not replied to any of my emails or letters
- She gives me a notice saying they did not have my address - which is nonsense
- She starts asking me questions about what I'm saying on Twitter and says the police will need to be called
- I say thank God, I have been stalked for nearly 2 years, I wrote to the GV numerous times about horrendous thing, and they ignored me so I would welcome the police getting involved
- The woman is a bit taken aback, Paqui is very nervous, but she then goes on to reiterate that I have been saying things online and the police must be called
- I find it very threatening

## Stolen iPad

- I can't find my iPad and I believe it is stolen.
- I ask Gloria at the conservatory if anyone has handed in an iPad.
- She becomes extremely concerned about it and we go looking around the building.
- Her concern for my iPad far extends any concern she might have had for me being terrorized by Domingo and his associates, which includes her.
- When we are upstairs, I speak to her about what's going on. I tell her I can't believe how it just goes on and on.
- She looks scared. She is shaking and her voice is trembling.
- I tell her "you know it's not just me they're looking at online". An alarmed flash crosses her face.
- She suggests I go and talk to Enric Gil who is works at the town hall in the capacity of welcoming foreign people.

## Enric Gil

- I go to see Enric. I know him already from before when I lived in Denia and we had friends in common.
- I tell him everything. 
- He says I should see the Denia local police who have a division for male violence.
- We go outside.
- I'm speaking to him and he's laughing at me while I do. I wonder if someone is behind me making faces or playing the fool. It's unsettling.
- He goes to talk to a local police officer and comes back.
- He says I cannot raise anything with them as I don't have a partner and they only deal with male violence when it occurs within a partnership.

## Change root password

- One evening, I change the root password on my laptop.
- The router is off.
- The following morning, half of my new root password appears on a fake account profile message.

## Text my family at the Chinese

- With my new iPhone, I send a text to my mother's mobile number at the Chinese while I'm having dinner.
- There is a celebratory noise from my phone, and from someone elses phone too.
- I'm not able to get through to my mother.
- I believe they are targeting my family now, phones, etc, for the purposed of fraud.

## Ana dresses as if she's pregnant

- The Ana lie continues and she choreographs me - tracks my movements using shared WhatsApp groups with the other teachers - in order to see her going to the toilet dressed as if she is pregnant.
- On one of the last times I attended classes at the conservatory, Ana is playing trumpet music on her laptop and I hear it from her classroom as I walk by.

## Threat to my life from the conservatory

- On March 12th, there is a concert at the .. in DÃ©nia
- It's a huge set up, all meant to terrify me
- All the pieces at the concert are related to things I have said on Twitter or in letters asking for help that were ignored
- People are coming in to listen, and they look at me and smile
- I recognise a couple as two people I saw on the beach following me and part of the group of people making sexual noises the February before
- At 7.30, the concert begins
- The door opens and in walks a woman who has dressed to look like Lorraine Blackbourn my friend who committed suicide
- She has done a really good job of looking like her
- At the same moment, my security camera at home goes off and makes an alarm on my phone. I don't have time to look
- The woman dressed as Lorraine (who I believe now is Carmen Cano, Domingo's sister) and a man sit directly behind me, seats have been saved for them
- When I got home, I checked my camera. At 7.30pm, recorded on my security camera, you can hear a group of men making ghost noises
- I'm blocked from downloading the videos of the concert on the system.

## Talking to the translator

- I get a translator to help me deal with the police.
- After my experience with the [police in Denia in February](february.md#policia-nacional), I believe I need firm proof of hacking before I can go to them.
- I tell her everything, the child sexual abuse I suffered and how it made me intolerant of children being sexualized at the conservatory, and how I had been targeted for basically mentioning that very informally in 2015. 
- On the Guardia Civil website there's a list of experts who analyze devices for hacking for the police.
- We look one up. My translator phones him, a perito in Alicante, Jorge. He sounds like he's totally stoned.

## Choir on the 13th

- I turn up to choir class the next day
- The teachers and the adult staff are angry with me
- I text a message to Chris BJ saying "I think all this aggression is probably training for my political career"
- Both the choir teacher and the woman who sits beside me's phones beep they've received a WhatsApp message
- They both read it at the same time
- The woman looks at me angrily
- The choir repertoire includes a song about domestic violence
- That night I become extremely anxious and scared

## Practice on the 14th

- I go into practice at the conservatory
- I'm extremely anxious and feel really uneasy in the piano room
- I call the Irish embassy from there looking for help
- On the way out I see Gloria. She's laughing at me saying, "finally you're leaving now"

## Nowhere big blokes

- I had been working at Nowhere that day, the 14th, I went back to work
- 5 big Russian or Ukrainian blokes come in and stand opposite me. They are pretending to talk about the computer. They are dressed like labourers.
- I find it extremely threatening.
- When I leave the offices about 2 hours later, they are outside at exactly the moment I step outside the door, with a blond woman I've seen before in the middle of them.

## The dose ramps up

- I believe today the dose of anxiety causing substances was increased at my flat because I began to be extraordinarily stressed and scared that night, probably after drinking a large tea.
- Given that I was not fearful after the ridiculous piano concert on the 12th, and went to choir on the 13th, it seems reasonable to suppose I was relatively unaffected by this choreographed terror, used to it maybe.
- However the link with Lorraine Blackbourn was indeed extremely sinister and I text and tweet to everyone that I would never commit suicide if I turn up dead and it looks like it.
- The following morning I am severely anxious. I'm bumping my head on things. I have to go to town. I am terrorized the whole way in and out. I feel horrendous.
- I believe I was on serious drugs at this point.

## My crypto account

- I lose access to my crypto account.
- I don't know if they have stolen 70K from me or not.
- My account is completely locked.
- I'm really concerned about this.

## Madrid

- I go to Madrid and stay from 15-24th March.

!!! important
    - My hotel costs run into the thousands but I feel I have no choice.

- When I get to Madrid, I buy a new Android phone for my Spanish SIM. A man in the phone shop appears to know who I am.
- I am followed and tracked in Madrid. 
- With my new phone things that I say to my friend at lunch are repeated on fake account profiles later on.
- I write a letter **by hand** to my parents. The first contact with them for nearly 3 years.
- I explain I'm being terrorized and by whom. I try to keep it calm because my parents are elderly, and I don't know how things are with them. I don't want to upset them too much.
- I tell them I believe that Domingo and his family are planning to murder me.
- I remind them of what he told me all those years ago, something that I had told them at that time.

## Denuncia Madrid

- With the help of a friend I made a proper denuncia to the police in Madrid.
- They tell us I need to get an expert to examine my devices in order to prove I've been hacked.
- I'm astonished.

## Expert

- We do some research into getting my devices examined for hacking.
- It can cost thousands.
- We find an expert in Alicante who is reasonable.

## Valencia

- I go back to Valencia and stay in hotels.
- I have a flight scheduled from Valencia to India at the end of the month so I need to be back in Valencia.
- In Valencia I feel like I am being constantly watched, people know who I am, and everything is extremely unfriendly. I believe now this is to do with whatever drug they gave me prior to me leaving, which was a high dose, and it has made me paranoid.
- Or I really was being watched everywhere I go as part of national violence against women networks.
- I was extremely paranoid and constantly stalked on Twitter.

![Love poem](../../content/tweets/taru-ann-poem-2.png){width=65%}

- At the same time, she retweets a pic from 12th June 2023, which I have been unable to locate so [asked the account owner about it directly](../../content/tweets/long-long-way-to-go.png)
- I begin to suspect that whoever is managing the Taru Ann account could be well known to me.
- On September 22nd, after weird communication from Trish Penny all summer, I wonder if Taru Ann is Trish from time to time: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1837596563557831058. The account likes my question in response.
