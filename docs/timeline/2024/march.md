## An inspector from the Generalitat comes to piano lesson

- It's Tuesday 5th March 2024.
- I arrive at my piano lesson and, after a minute or two, all of a sudden, a woman enters the classroom.
- Paqui explains the woman in an inspector from the Generalitat and she is here to help me.
- I feel like it's probably an ambush and put my phone on record.
- Paqui reiterates that the woman is here to help me with everything that's going on, and I relate what she's saying to how I have previously told her I'm stressed because I'm being terrorized. 
- The woman talks about having to get the police involved.
- I am delighted and express gratitude because something is finally happening after nearly two years of abuse instigated by a teacher, Domingo Cano.
- I ask her why the Generalitat has not replied to any of my emails or letters.
- She says they did but they not have my street address!
- She tells me they did reply in December but it came back to them because they did not have my street address.
- I mention that I sent the notices by email and that my address is in the systems and that they could have asked, or informed me, at any time.
- She ignores me.

    - [Document receipt copy with date info](../../content/documents/gv/8.%20Receipt%20date%20received%205%20March%20at%20piano%20lesson.JPG)
    - [The document receipt](../../content/documents/gv/8.%20Receipt%20of%20something%20from%20the%20Generalitat%201%205%20March%202023.jpeg)
    - [A part of the document they apparently sent](../../content/documents/gv/8.%20Receipt%20of%20something%20from%20the%20Generalitat%202%205%20March%202023.jpeg)

- Paqui looks nervous.
- I ask her for the content of the letter which I do not see.
- The woman's tone is not at all friendly towards me. She says, oh that doesn't matter now.
- She starts saying everything is too public now and that the police will need to be called.
- I say thank God, I have been stalked for nearly 2 years, I wrote to the GV numerous times about this horrible situation where a student is being terrorized by teachers, and everyone ignored me so I would welcome the police getting involved.
- The woman is a bit taken aback, Paqui is very nervous, but she then goes on to reiterate that I have been saying things online and the police must be called.
- She starts asking me questions about what I'm saying on Twitter.
- I find it very threatening, I tell her I don't like the way she is talking to me, and say that I'm not speaking to her further without a lawyer present.
- The woman leaves.

## Stolen iPad

- I can't find my iPad and I believe it is stolen.
- I ask Gloria at the conservatory if anyone has handed in an iPad.
- She becomes extremely concerned about it and we go looking around the building.
- She is really upset about the thought an iPad might have been stolen. I find it astonishing.
- Her concern for my iPad far extends any concern she might have had for me being terrorized by Domingo and his associates, which includes her.
- When we are upstairs, I speak to her about what's going on privately. I tell her I can't believe how it just goes on and on.
- She looks scared. She is shaking and her voice is trembling.
- I tell her "you know it's not just me they're looking at online". An alarmed flash crosses her face.
- She suggests I go and talk to Enric Gil who is works at the town hall in the capacity of welcoming foreign people who have just moved to the area.

## Enric Gil

- I go to see Enric. I know him already from  when I lived in Denia previously in 2006-9, and we had friends in common.
- I tell him everything. 
- As I start to mention the threats from Domingo he shuts me down.
- He says I should see the Denia local police who have a division for gender violence.
- We go outside.
- I'm speaking to him and he's laughing at me while I do. I wonder if someone is behind me making faces or playing the fool. It's unsettling.
- He goes to talk to a local police officer and comes back.
- He says I cannot raise anything with them as I don't have a partner and they only deal with male violence when it occurs within a partnership.

## Human Rights

- I don't know what to do, where to turn, who to ask for help.
- The Policia Nacional are disinterested, the local police don't want to know, the Generalitat is suggesting they are going to have me arrested for being a victim of cyber stalking and gang stalking and talking about it on Twitter, it's overwhelmingly stressful.
- I search for a human rights lawyer and send some random emails to try and get help.
- I search for the European Court of Human Rights to try to reach out to them.
- I'm unable to access their website, in the same way I could not access the website of the Guardia Civil and others.
- I manage to put a [message in their contact box](../../content/documents/letters/echr-message.pdf) which I assume they will likely not receive.
- That day, I'm followed by accounts related to human rights.

![Human rights fake account](../../content/images/fake-accounts/human-rights-accs/Screenshot%202024-03-08%20at%2008.35.00.png)

- I was able to finally communicate with the ECHR when I was in Brussels in July: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1811523447123558841.

## Change root password

- One evening, I change the root password on my laptop.
- The router is off.
- The following morning, half of my new root password appears on a fake account's profile message.

## I buy an analogue phone

- I buy a simple phone which won't have access to Internet on Amazon: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/your-account/order-details?ie=UTF8&orderID=203-8343216-4317911&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_order_details

## Report hacking to work

- It's Friday 8th March.
- I opened a Twitter account for work on my work laptop, I can't remember when.
- Immediately, I was followed by accounts with names related to the gang stalking.
- I filed it away, it was too much to deal with at that moment, although I did raise a ticket with IT at one point when I saw something weird.
- With everything going on, I realize it's time to tell the security department at my work I think I've been hacked.
- Gordon Bishop of Polygon Labs investigates. 
- He asks me to access 1.1.1.1 on my browser. What he's expecting to happen, doesn't happen. 
- He's expecting to see the WARP webpage but, instead, we get the login page for the network router.

![Router login](../../content/images/hacked-work-laptop/router-login.png){width=65%}

- He also sees some weird stuff with Mac certificates.

![Mac certificates](../../content/images/hacked-work-laptop/weird-issues-with-certificates.png){width=65%}

- He says this is enough evidence of hacking through the router for them to lock me down and reformat my laptop.
- I have to work somewhere else while I get a new router and change the ISP from Yoigo to Movistar.
- They put the FalconSensorMacOS.MaverickGyr.pkg on both my work and my personal laptop.
- A few hours later, a stalker account tweets about 11.11 and references relationships.

![Tweet about 11:11](../../content/images/hacked-work-laptop/stalker-account-mentions-it.png){width=65%}

- The following day, I tweet about it.

![Tweet about 11:11](../../content/images/hacked-work-laptop/router-hack-tweet.png){width=65%}

- At this point, I block all my cameras on laptops and phones. 

## Nowhere

- I get a desk at Nowhere co-working space in Denia: https://www.knowheredenia.com.

## Scarfs from the lady who knows who I am

- I buy some scarves from a shop in the Calle La Mar, could be Vintage Ibiza.
- It's run by a polish woman who is very nice.
- We chat and I tell her I'm studying piano at the conservatory.
- She becomes very embarrassed and is unable to speak to me. She knows who I am.
- This shop had a picture in the window of Frida Khalo for months.
- Often, in the Google search results for `@jctot19` there were pictures of Frida Khalo and references to the trumpet teacher having another girlfriend.
- Ridiculous, I know.
- Amazing that the people of Denia would put so much effort into all this, and it must have cost a lot of time, effort, and money to keep it going. 
- I now wonder if they were perhaps making more money than they were spending from either:
    - Mass voyeurism on social media of "hunted" or targeted women in Spain.
    - Mass voyeurism of women being filmed on hidden cameras in their homes, possibly amateur porn networks, something I often saw in my Google results.
    - Mass voyeurism of people who enjoy watching others suffer.

## Text my family at the Chinese

- Online, the stalkers are continuing to suggest I call my family.
- With my iPhone, I send a text to my mother's mobile number at the Chinese while I'm having dinner one Sunday evening.
- There is a celebratory noise from my phone, and from someone elses phone too nearby.
- I'm not able to get through to my mother.
- I believe they are trying to target my family now, with phone numbers, etc, for the purposed of fraud.

## Ana dresses as if she's pregnant

- The Ana lie continues and, with the help of others, she choreographs ridiculous situations - tracks my movements using shared WhatsApp groups with the other teachers - in order that I see her going to the toilet dressed as if she is pregnant.
- On one of the last times I attended classes at the conservatory, Ana is playing trumpet music on her laptop and I hear it from her classroom as I walk by.

## Cracked rib

- I crack a rib during yoga class.
- I wonder if whatever I'm ingesting causes bone thinning because it happened again a few months later.
- I have to pause yoga for a month or so while it gets better.
- It's good timing.
- Some drugs make your bones thinner and make it more likely to experience this sort of thing.

## Serious threat to my life and mental/emotional wellness from the piano department at Denia conservatory

- On March 12th, there is a end of term piano concert at the Casa de Cultura in Dénia.
- It's a huge set up, all meant to terrify me
- All the pieces at the concert are related to things I have said on Twitter or in letters asking for help that were ignored
- People are coming in to listen, and they look at me and smile
- I recognise a couple as two people I saw on the beach following me and part of the group of people making sexual noises the February before
- At 7.30, the concert begins
- The door opens and in walks a woman who has dressed to look like Lorraine Blackbourn my friend who committed suicide
- She has done a really good job of looking like her
- At the same moment, my security camera at home goes off and makes an alarm on my phone. I don't have time to look
- The woman dressed as Lorraine (who I believe now is Carmen Cano, Domingo's sister) and a man sit directly behind me, seats have been saved for them
- When I got home, I checked my camera. At 7.30pm, recorded on my security camera, you can hear a group of men making ghost noises
- I'm blocked from downloading the videos of the concert on the system.

## Coinbase

- That evening I lose access to my Coinbase account with 70K in it.
- It's not clear if I've locked it myself or it has been breached by hackers.

## Talking to the translator

- I get a translator to help me deal with the police.
- After my experience with the [police in Denia in February](february.md#policia-nacional), I believe I need firm proof of hacking before I can go to them.
- I tell her everything, the child sexual abuse I suffered and how it made me intolerant of children being sexualized at the conservatory, and how I had been targeted for basically mentioning that very informally in 2015. 
- On the Guardia Civil website there's a list of experts who analyze devices for hacking for the police.
- We look one up. My translator phones him, a perito in Alicante, Jorge. He sounds like he's totally stoned.

## Choir on the 13th

- I turn up to choir class the next day
- The teachers and the adult staff are angry with me
- I text a message to Chris BJ saying "I think all this aggression is probably training for my political career"
- Both the choir teacher and the woman who sits beside me's phones beep they've received a WhatsApp message
- They both read it at the same time
- The woman looks at me angrily
- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1773436669007380597
- The choir repertoire includes a song about domestic violence
- That night I become extremely anxious and scared.
- On my way home, through the tunnel, a man comes at me and blows in my face.

## Practice on the 14th

- I go into practice at the conservatory
- I'm extremely anxious and feel really uneasy in the piano room
- I call the Irish embassy from there looking for help
- On the way out I see Gloria. She's laughing at me saying, "finally you're leaving now".

## Nowhere big blokes

- I had been working at Nowhere that day, the 14th, I went back to work
- 5 big Russian or Ukrainian blokes come in and stand opposite me. They are pretending to talk about the computer. They are dressed like labourers.
- I find it extremely threatening.
- When I leave the offices about 2 hours later, they are outside at exactly the moment I step outside the door, with a blond woman I've seen before in the middle of them.

## The dose ramps up

- I believe today the dose of anxiety causing substances was increased at my flat because I began to be extraordinarily stressed and scared that night, probably after drinking a large tea.
- Given that I was not fearful after the ridiculous piano concert on the 12th, and went to choir on the 13th, it seems reasonable to suppose I was relatively unaffected by this choreographed terror, used to it maybe.
- However the link with Lorraine Blackbourn was indeed extremely sinister and I text and tweet to everyone that I would never commit suicide if I turn up dead and it looks like I did: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1768046490272870687.
- The following morning I am severely anxious. I'm bumping my head on things. I have to go to town. I am terrorized the whole way in and out. I feel horrendous.
- I believe I was on serious drugs at this point.

## My crypto account

- I lose access to my crypto account.
- I don't know if they have stolen 70K from me or not.
- My account is completely locked.
- I'm really concerned about this.
- I tweet about it: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1768093834188087798.

## Chest infection

- I get very unwell after choir class, a cold which becomes a chest infection.
- It doesn't get better, it gets worse and worse.
- I'm extremely unwell in Madrid, I can hardly talk.
- Eventually, in India in the first week of April, I'm prescribed hardcore antibiotics and medicine for pleurisy.
- It's not before I snap a rib from coughing.
- The medication works and I recover.

## Madrid

- I go to Madrid and stay from 15-24th March.

!!! important
    - My hotel costs run into the thousands but I feel I have no choice.

- The threats continue: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1769859075813101947.
- More threats: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1769860927296258167.
- When I get to Madrid, I buy a new Android phone for my Spanish SIM. A man in the phone shop appears to know who I am.
- I am followed and tracked in Madrid. 
- With my new phone things that I say to my friend at lunch are repeated on fake account profiles later on.
- I write a letter **by hand** to my parents. The first contact with them for nearly 3 years.
- I explain I'm being terrorized and by whom. I try to keep it calm because my parents are elderly, and I don't know how things are with them. I don't want to upset them too much.
- I tell them I believe that Domingo and his family are planning to murder me.
- I remind them of what he told me all those years ago, something that I had told them at that time.

## Denuncia Madrid

- With the help of a friend I made a proper denuncia to the police in Madrid.
- They tell us I need to get an expert to examine my devices in order to prove I've been hacked.
- I'm astonished.

## Expert

- We do some research into getting my devices examined for hacking.
- It can cost thousands.
- We find an expert in Alicante who is reasonable.

## Valencia

- I go back to Valencia and stay in hotels.
- I have a flight scheduled from Valencia to India at the end of the month so I need to be back in Valencia.
- In Valencia I feel like I am being constantly watched, people know who I am, and everything is extremely unfriendly. I believe now this is to do with whatever drug they gave me prior to me leaving, which was a high dose, and it has made me paranoid.
- Or I really was being watched everywhere I go as part of national violence against women networks.
- I was extremely paranoid and constantly stalked on Twitter.

## Tweets

### `@1frgvn`

- https://x.com/january_myth/status/1772034747775992249 -> the Taru Ann account, which may be sometimes run by Trish Penny retweets a post from 29th August 2023.

![Love poem](../../content/tweets/taru-ann-poem-2.png){width=65%}

- At the same time, she retweets a pic from 12th June 2023, which I have been unable to locate so [asked the account owner about it directly](../../content/tweets/long-long-way-to-go.png)
- I begin to suspect that whoever is managing the Taru Ann account could be well known to me.
- On September 22nd, after weird communication from Trish Penny all summer, I wonder if Taru Ann is Trish from time to time: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1837596563557831058. The account likes my question in response.

### `@JackChardwood`

It seems the tweets in here are mostly related to romance and relationship, i.e. keeping the lie going.
