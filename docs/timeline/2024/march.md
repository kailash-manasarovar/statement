## Inspector from the Generalitat 

- I arrive at piano class on March 5th and all of a sudden a woman enters the class
- Paqui explains she is here to help me
- I am delighted and ask her why the GV have not replied to any of my emails or letters
- She gives me a notice saying they did not have my address - which is nonsense
- She starts asking me questions about what I'm saying on Twitter and says the police will need to be called
- I say thank God, I have been stalked for nearly 2 years, I wrote to the GV numerous times about horrendous thing, and they ignored me so I would welcome the police getting involved
- The woman is a bit taken aback, Paqui is very nervous, but she then goes on to reiterate that I have been saying things online and the police must be called
- I find it very threatening

## Threat to my life from the conservatory

- On March 12th, there is a concert at the .. in Dénia
- It's a huge set up, all meant to terrify me
- All the pieces at the concert are related to things I have said on Twitter or in letters asking for help that were ignored
- People are coming in to listen, and they look at me and smile
- I recognise a couple as two people I saw on the beach following me and part of the group of people making sexual noises the February before
- At 7.30, the concert begins
- The door opens and in walks a woman who has dressed to look like Lorraine Blackbourn my friend who committed suicide
- She has done a really good job of looking like her
- At the same moment, my security camera at home goes off and makes an alarm on my phone. I don't have time to look
- The woman dressed as Lorraine (who I believe now is Carmen Cano, Domingo's sister) and a man sit directly behind me, seats have been saved for them
- When I got home, I checked my camera. At 7.30pm, recorded on my security camera, you can hear a group of men making ghost noises

## Talking to the translator

- Perito in Alicante sounds like he's stoned

## Choir on the 13th

- I turn up to choir class the next day
- The teachers and the adult staff are angry with me
- I text a message to Chris BJ saying "I think all this aggression is probably training for my political career"
- Both the choir teacher and the woman who sits beside me's phones beep they've received a WhatsApp message
- They both read it at the same time
- The woman looks at me angrily
- The choir repertoire includes a song about domestic violence
- That night I become extremely anxious and scared
- I text and tweet to everyone that I would never commit suicide

## Nowhere big blokes

- I go to Nowhere to work the following day, Thursday 14th
- 5 big Russian or Ukrainian blokes come in and stand opposite me. They are pretending to talk about the computer. They are dressed like labourers.
- I find it extremely threatening.
- When I leave the offices, they are outside with a blond woman in the middle of them.

## Madrid

- I book a hotel in Madrid and leave Dénia.
