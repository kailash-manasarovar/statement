## Madrid New Year

## Back in DÃ©nia

- I am so high after Christmas and New Year. All the chats and interaction make me think I have a boyfriend.

!!! info "Disclaimer"
    - I don't really think this, not really, it's too absurd, but I can't seem to unhook myself from the game.
    - I think this is proof I'm being drugged and manipulated by online seduction techniques.
     
- There is a DM chat with a fake account: https://x.com/ItsMe50474936 that I'm sure is either the trumpet teacher or someone close to him.
- It's the same account that posted the [hotel room selfie-pic](../2023/december.md#hotel-room-selfie-pic) a few days before.

- This account also says they're nervous they're "actually" talking to me instead of seeing me in the group.

    - Do they pay for this access to me?

## `@JackChardwood` account content completely changed

- Up until early January, on my `@JackChardwood` account, I see mostly rather boring content about tech and self-help, motivational stuff. It's really very boring.
- Suddenly, the timeline has completely changed and it is now posting spiritual account, lot of love and romance accounts, nothing like I was seeing before.
- It's weird. I note it.

## Galway

- I set up a new fake account

- He hasn't posted since the 15th January 2024, or he has deleted his posts from then.
- The highlighted post from 9th January, mentioning the *chica*, appears to be referring to me. The account he is replying to is protected so I cannot see the conversation. The implication is that I am chasing him again and again. However, this is undoubtedly what he, Domingo, and their co-conspirators have been setting me up to *appear* to be doing.
- This was after Christmas where I was extraordinarily high, flying is an understatement, and we have plenty of witnesses to that. I was exuberant. 
- I look back and see I must have been drugged with something.
- At that time, there were DM'ed conversations between myself and someone pretending to be him (the American account, Matthew). I relate all this in the [December 2023 section](../2023/december.md).
- Then there was another account in January that chatted with me, pretending to be him.
- I had gone to Dublin on my therapy course that [January 2024](january.md), opened an anonymous account on Twitter, followed `@jctot19` on it, and posted solely to my timeline without interacting with his account directly at all.
- I posted about my therapy, and looked on his timeline for responses, as before.
- The first post I had seen on his timeline during that time had been an angel climbing a ladder to heaven, so I continued.
- I posted one tweet with a sexual connotation and he immediately posts the response from 15th January where he apparently randomly reaches out to a woman he hasn't seen in years.
- I immediately stop communicating with him and delete the twitter account I had created.

!!! important
    - It may be helpful to know that if at any time the trumpet teacher had been honest with me, that would have been that.
    - Instead, he and his teams created convoluted situations in which I was always questioning whether he was interested or not, I was never really sure, and so it kept me hanging on in the attempt to find out what was going on, at a minimum.
    - And on top of that, somehow I was being spiked with drugs or herbs that made me extremely sexually aroused, and led me to masturbate for an unseen audience, while I was also being groomed HEAVILY online with MRA seduction tactics on Twitter and elsewhere.
    - We have to assume that I am the tip of the iceberg with regards to these sorts of honey-trap manipulation techniques and it is highly likely children are being targeted in the same way.

## Dick pics from the choir master

- The evening after my first choir class that year, on Twitter, an account named Salva, posted a dick pic.
- I mention [dick pics on Twitter on 17th January 2024](https://x.com/search?q=dick%20pic%20(from%3A1frgvn)&src=typed_query&f=live) right before choir class.
- About half an hour into the class, Salva's WhatsApp beeps, and he takes out his phone to look at his messages.
- Suddenly, he's enraged. 
- He makes a dreadful fool of himself by talking about terrible things that happen to people. 
- I'm paraphrasing and misquoting, but the gist was someone in a class one time, who thought they were a spiritual mystic but were in fact psychotic and mentally ill, brought a knife in and stabbed everyone. He may have even mentioned horrible details about cutting parts of people. It was unbelievable.
- I'm appalled at his behavior in class. So is Samuel. 
- Salva says things that would make parents stop their children coming to his class, if they knew.
- Someone unknown had sent him a link to my posts at that moment, for a joke, and, due to the guilt, he became uncontrollably enraged.
