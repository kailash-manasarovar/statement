## Back in DÃ©nia

- I am so high after Christmas and New Year. All the chats and interaction make me think I have a boyfriend.

!!! info "Disclaimer"
    - I don't really think this, not really, it's too absurd, but I can't seem to unhook myself from the game.
    - I think this is proof I'm being drugged and manipulated by online seduction techniques.
     
- There is a DM chat with a fake account: https://x.com/ItsMe50474936 that I'm sure is either the trumpet teacher or someone close to him.
- It's the same account that posted the [hotel room selfie-pic](../2023/december.md#hotel-room-selfie-pic) a few days before.
- https://x.com/ItsMe50474936
- This account also says they're nervous they're "actually" talking to me instead of seeing me in the group.

!!! info
    - Do they pay for this access to me?

## `@JackChardwood` account content completely changed

- Up until early January, on my `@JackChardwood` account, I see mostly rather boring content about tech and self-help, motivational stuff. It's really very boring.
- Suddenly, the timeline has completely changed and it is now posting spiritual account, lot of love and romance accounts, nothing like I was seeing before.
- It's weird. I note it: https://x.com/JackChardwood/status/1750917604393308599

## Galway

- I set up a new fake account

- He hasn't posted since the 15th January 2024, or he has deleted his posts from then.
- The highlighted post from 9th January, mentioning the *chica*, appears to be referring to me. The account he is replying to is protected so I cannot see the conversation. The implication is that I am chasing him again and again. However, this is undoubtedly what he, Domingo, and their co-conspirators have been setting me up to *appear* to be doing.
- This was after Christmas where I was extraordinarily high, flying is an understatement, and we have plenty of witnesses to that. I was exuberant. 
- I look back and see I must have been drugged with something.
- At that time, there were DM'ed conversations between myself and someone pretending to be him (the American account, Matthew). I relate all this in the [December 2023 section](../2023/december.md).
- Then there was another account in January that chatted with me, pretending to be him.
- I had gone to Dublin on my therapy course that [January 2024](january.md), opened an anonymous account on Twitter, followed `@jctot19` on it, and posted solely to my timeline without interacting with his account directly at all.
- I posted about my therapy, and looked on his timeline for responses, as before.
- The first post I had seen on his timeline during that time had been an angel climbing a ladder to heaven, so I continued.
- I posted one tweet with a sexual connotation and he immediately posts the response from 15th January where he apparently randomly reaches out to a woman he hasn't seen in years.
- I immediately stop communicating with him and delete the twitter account I had created.

!!! important
    - It may be helpful to know that if at any time the trumpet teacher had been honest with me, that would have been that.
    - Instead, he and his teams created convoluted situations in which I was always questioning whether he was interested or not, I was never really sure, and so it kept me hanging on in the attempt to find out what was going on, at a minimum.
    - And on top of that, somehow I was being spiked with drugs or herbs that made me extremely sexually aroused, and led me to masturbate for an unseen audience, while I was also being groomed HEAVILY online with MRA seduction tactics on Twitter and elsewhere.
    - We have to assume that I am the tip of the iceberg with regards to these sorts of honey-trap manipulation techniques and it is highly likely children are being targeted in the same way.

## Google search

- I am seeing multiple posts about "boyfriends" on my images. I believe that's what this tweet is referring to: https://x.com/JackChardwood/status/1742110623490506940
- I mention this on Twitter: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1748488576860389657
- How do they do it? I ask: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1748485970272419873. I thought it might be cookies but I used someone else's device once to check and the results were the same. Unless they had hacked that person's phone too.
- Ana Girbes as fierce transformer cartoon.

## Ana and Ana

- Health matters
- Choreographed ridiculousness
- Furious at me
- Google search Ana Girbes transformer figure with guns

## Conservatory

- I believe I can trust Paqui. At some point, I told her they were terrorizing me. 
- I believe it was just before a piano concert at the social centre in Denia in January 2024 which the students of the conservatory are usually invited to. She asked me was I going to go, and I asked her if it was safe for me to go.
- She seemed alarmed at my question which is when I told her I was being terrorized by men, Domingo and others.
- I had no idea she was 100% involved.
- Furthermore, the women Ana Requena and Ana Girbes are angry with me, as is Katia in my chamber music class, and I feel it is very unfair. 
- I can't believe they would be involved in all this and, at this point, I try to reach out to them.

### January 18th 

- I [text Katia](../../content/whatsapps/text-to-katia.pdf). Katia does not reply or even mention the text when I see her next at class.
- I also [email the GV again](../../content/documents/emails/jan-18-email-to-GV.pdf) with an update of what's going on.
- The GV reply to tell me they have transferred my email to the Alicante office and I have to ask them for information on who I can contact there.

## Nacho follows me around town

- ..

## Nacho pokes his head

- And says sorry

## Dick pics from the choir master

- The evening after my first choir class that year, on Twitter, an account named Salva, posted a dick pic.
- I mention [dick pics on Twitter on 17th January 2024](https://x.com/search?q=dick%20pic%20(from%3A1frgvn)&src=typed_query&f=live) right before choir class.
- About half an hour into the class, Salva's WhatsApp beeps, and he takes out his phone to look at his messages.
- Suddenly, he's enraged. 
- He makes a dreadful fool of himself by talking about terrible things that happen to people. 
- I'm paraphrasing and misquoting, but the gist was someone in a class one time, who thought they were a spiritual mystic but were in fact psychotic and mentally ill, brought a knife in and stabbed everyone. He may have even mentioned horrible details about cutting parts of people. It was unbelievable.
- I'm appalled at his behavior in class. So is Samuel. 
- Salva says things that would make parents stop their children coming to his class, if they knew.
- Someone unknown had sent him a link to my posts at that moment, for a joke, and, due to the guilt, he became uncontrollably enraged.

## Threatening men outside

- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1747283258092425350
- In general, the threat level is growing in the town, at the conservatory, and online. 
- No one speaks to me, at all, but they are all extremely busy choreographing ridiculous "moments" which will "make me think" something about something.
- It's extraordinarily evil and I can hardly believe it.
- I often wonder how many others they have done this too. At the time of writing, I wonder as well how many of those they did do it to ended up in prostitution or porn, and were they targeted as minors.

## Twitter

### @1frgvn

There's a lot of confirmation of what I have been saying here in these tweets. It's like I had time to breathe and assess things in the second half of this month. Did they stop spiking me/and manipulating me online temporarily?

Earlier in the month I remain exuberant and there are lots of deleted tweets, and suspended and deleted accounts involved.

- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1752602299803783584 -> talking about the smile of the trumpet teacher in Benijembla and class.
- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1752342228465262902 -> in reference to the sad woman at Benijembla.

- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1751145935646621796 -> stalker account `@AIinAmerica`. This one posted the boy that even today comes up first on Google searches. I'm supposed to think it's the trumpet teacher as a young man. I don't. In fact, I think I saw the actual man this is a picture of on the Las Marinas beach in October 2024.

![Current google searches with the young man](../../content/images/google-searches/google-search-young-man.png){width=85%}
