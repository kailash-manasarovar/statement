## Madrid New Year

## Back in DÃ©nia

- There is a DM chat with a fake account that I'm sure is either the trumpet teacher or someone close to him.
- It's the same account that posted the [hotel room selfie-pic](../2023/december.md#hotel-room-selfie-pic) a few days before.

- This account also says they're nervous they're "actually" talking to me instead of seeing me in the group.

    - Do they pay for this?

## `@JackChardwood` account content completely changed

- Up until early January, on my `@JackChardwood` account, I see mostly rather boring content about tech and self-help, motivational stuff. It's really very boring.
- Suddenly, the timeline has completely changed and it is now posting spiritual account, lot of love and romance accounts, nothing like I was seeing before.
- It's weird. I note it.

## Dick pics from the choir master

- The evening after my first choir class that year, on Twitter, an account named Salva, posted a dick pic.
- I mention [dick pics on Twitter on 17th January 2024](https://x.com/search?q=dick%20pic%20(from%3A1frgvn)&src=typed_query&f=live) right before choir class.
- About half an hour into the class, Salva's WhatsApp beeps, and he takes out his phone to look at his messages.
- Suddenly, he's enraged. 
- He makes a dreadful fool of himself by talking about terrible things that happen to people. 
- I'm paraphrasing and misquoting, but the gist was someone in a class one time, who thought they were a spiritual mystic but were in fact psychotic and mentally ill, brought a knife in and stabbed everyone. He may have even mentioned horrible details about cutting parts of people. It was unbelievable.
- I'm appalled at his behavior in class. So is Samuel. 
- Salva says things that would make parents stop their children coming to his class, if they knew.
- Someone unknown had sent him a link to my posts at that moment, for a joke, and, due to the guilt, he became uncontrollably enraged.
