## Dick pics

- The evening after my first choir class that year, on Twitter, an account named Salva, posted a dick pic.
- I mention [dick pics on Twitter on 17th January 2024](https://x.com/search?q=dick%20pic%20(from%3A1frgvn)&src=typed_query&f=live) right before choir class.
- About half an hour into the class, Salva's WhatsApp beeps, and he takes out his phone to look at his messages.
- Suddenly, he's enraged. He makes a fool of himself by talking about terrible things that happen to people. 
- I'm appalled at his behavior in class. So is Samuel. 
- Salva says things that would make parents stop their children coming to his class, if they knew.
- I also know someone had sent him a link to my posts at that moment and, due to the guilt, he became uncontrollably enraged.
