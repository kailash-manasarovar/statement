## Choir class

- Salva, the choir master, tells us we're going to be singing a new tune for a concert at the Centro Social before Easter. 
- It is a song about domestic violence, ostensibly written with the intention of helping women in distress, but Salva's use of it is very much in "celebration of" domestic violence, which I am, arguably, suffering at the hands of the whole town and beyond.
- There's an intense aggression towards me in the classroom.
- I realize that one of the songs we are singing has a repeated refrain, "ka ka ka". I know he's taking the piss with this too. 

## Constant stalking

- Ana Girbes continues to be really angry at me for no reason, as does Ana Requena.
- On February 14th, Valentine's day, as I'm climbing the stairs to choir, Ana and Ana are sitting with their backs to me in Ana Girbes classroom. 
- Ana Requena rushes out and stairs at my face without saying anything at all to me.
- I assume the intention is for me to think she is concerned I will have put makeup on for valentine's day.

## Highlights on Twitter

- It's exhausting and I'm really upset at how I'm being treated.
- I start to write my story and publish it on Twitter highlights.

### The story published in highlights

- Part one - collecting my thoughts (the story): https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1759737292472627532
- Part two - the trumpet teacher: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1759770318409695275 
- Part three - hacking: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1759837709365817828

## Another email to the school board

- I email the Alicante school board as suggested by the previous response from January:
    - [Another complaint in English](../../content/documents/emails/feb-10-email-to-alicante-en.pdf)
    - [Another complaint in Spanish](../../content/documents/emails/feb-10-email-to-alicante-es.pdf)
    - [Proof of sending via email](../../content/documents/emails/receipt-of-feb-email.pdf) -> this includes an extra email I wrote about my concerns that Mercedes Correas would lie about me and proof that was sent also.

## Twitter starts to get more threatening

- Initially, they do this via a weird fake account, Mark Moseley, who is just like the other fake accounts but decidedly more violent in tone.
- The Mark Moseley account has been tracking me for a few weeks. I, again, think it is the trumpet teacher. There are many details of things only he or his associates could know.
- I tell him I don't believe who he says he is. He posts an identification document for Mark Moseley from Portland Oregon.
- I guess it's another delegate account.
- He tells me now he prayed incessantly for something, help, and I came along. It seemed reasonable to me, still does.
- In a DM, he tries to recruit me to their honey trap organization. This is on February 20th.
- I refuse in no uncertain terms.
- I have a copy of [my side of the conversation](../../content/images/threats/mark-moseley-mail.pdf) and I am sure this document contained both sides of the conversation when I originally copied it. 
- At the end of this chat, when I refuse to sign up to whatever he wants me to do - he'd said using fake accounts to find lonely men looking for love, or something like this - he threatens me with violence.
- His message says: "I hope you find a good plastic surgeon for your face."

- He says something else threatening about me.

![Threat of violence from Mark Mosely account](../../content/images/threats/threat-2.png){width=65%}

- And there are some other threats around this from other accounts which are unsettling. An example:

![Threat of violence from Mark Mosely account](../../content/images/threats/threats-around-threats.png){width=65%}

- I consider the threat to be credible and to mean that someone may throw acid on my face.
- A lot of my Twitter pals suggest reporting to the police: https://x.com/search?q=(to%3A1frgvn)%20until%3A2024-02-21%20since%3A2024-02-19&src=typed_query&f=live
- He has deleted the account now, although just two days ago when I was checking, the message was there (21 November 2024) and the account was still active. 

!!! danger "Hackers still active - November 2024"
    - I'm still being tracked and I'm still being hacked.
    - They have deleted the Mark Moseley account at just the time I'm going to be writing about it.

- Perhaps the message is salvageable in Twitter caches.
- I sent a copy of the threat to the Alicante directorate too, asking them if they would do something now.

![Threat of violence on Twitter](../../content/images/threats/threat-of-violence-twitter.png)

- There was, of course, no reply from them.
- I am starting to get seriously stressed and anxious now. I'm scared. 

## Guardia Civil

- I try to access the Guardia Civil webpage for reporting gender violence and cyber stalking. 
- The page fails to load at every attempt to access it. It's not a 404, or any normal error. It's like a not connected to the internet error, except I am. I literally cannot access any reporting pages on the Guardia Civil website at all.
- I know now I was blocked from accessing the Guardia Civil's gender violence and cyber stalking reporting line by hackers.

## Policia Nacional

- Having been threatened with real violence, I go to report the gang stalking and everything to the police in DÃ©nia the next morning.
- I take all my documentation in Spanish detailing the story so far.
- The policeman who deals with me reads the two letters I wrote to Concha the June before, tells me there is no crime and I should go home.
- I have a stack of documentation I would like them to read, which I have posted here up to know, but they are not at all interested.
- They tell me I need to take a civil case out against the conservatory.
- I explain I'm being hacked. They say, how can teachers at the conservatory hack you, they are musicians.
- I tell them about the threat I received online the night before. They read and tell me, "oh, he can say that because he probably thinks you're ugly".
- I'm utterly flabbergasted, and leave.
- While I was there, a woman police officer was holding up her mobile phone as if she was filming me the whole time.
- I wondered if they knew exactly who I was and what was happening to me. It seemed so.

## Report hacking to work

- They find evidence of hacking.
- I have to work somewhere else while I get a new router.

## Nowhere

- Get a desk at Nowhere.

## Human Rights

-

## Cracked rib

- During this month I crack a rib during yoga class.
- I wonder if whatever I'm ingesting causes bone thinning because it happened again a few months later.
- I have to pause yoga for a month or so while it gets better.
