## Choir class

- Salva, the choir master, tells us we're going to be singing a new tune for a concert at the Centro Social before Easter. 
- It is a song about domestic violence, ostensibly written with the intention of helping women in distress, but Salva's use of it is very much in "celebration of" domestic violence, which I am, arguably, suffering at the hands of the whole town and beyond.
- There's an intense aggression towards me in the classroom.
- I realize that one of the songs we are singing has a repeated refrain, "ka ka ka". I know he's taking the piss with this too.

## New e-SIM with Yoigo

- I try to get a new SIM from Yoigo on 7th February.
- It's such a complicated business, I never manage to set it up, even though they sent me detailed instructions.
- The relevant part of the instructions on email was missing, i.e. QR code, so I was never able to set up the e-SIM.
- I believe the email was interfered with and the QR code removed or made unreadable so that I could not set up the e-SIM.

## Constant gang stalking at the conservatory

- Ana Girbes continues to be really angry at me for no reason, as does Ana Requena.
- On February 14th, Valentine's day, as I'm climbing the stairs to choir, Ana and Ana are sitting with their backs to me in Ana Girbes classroom. 
- Ana Requena rushes out and stares at my face angrily without saying anything at all to me.
- I assume the intention is for me to think she is concerned I will have put makeup on for Valentine's day.
- It's absolutely ridiculous and I know they are laughing at me as I continue on up.
- I wonder now what they thought they were achieving and/or if their purpose was that I would have a nervous breakdown or kill myself.
- For sure, at a minimum, they intended I have a severe nervous breakdown.

## Highlights on Twitter

- It's exhausting and I'm really upset at how I'm being treated.
- I start to write my story and publish it on Twitter highlights.
- Everything in highlights relates to gang stalking: https://x.com/1FRGVN/highlights.

### The story published in highlights

- Part one - collecting my thoughts (the story): https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1759737292472627532
- Part two - the trumpet teacher: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1759770318409695275 
- Part three - hacking: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1759837709365817828
- Part four - manipulating and involving the children: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1759864483244089476 -> I think the information in this statement covers that.

## Another email to the school board

- Things are getting worse and I'm getting more and more stressed.
- No one communicates with me and no one is trying to help me.
- I'm completely alone and the weight of what is going on for me is becoming overwhelming.
- It seems sensible to have some formal documentation on record and so I email the Generalitat Valenciana in Alicante, details given by the previous brief response I received in January:
    - [Another complaint in English](../../content/documents/emails/feb-10-email-to-alicante-en.pdf).
    - [Another complaint in Spanish](../../content/documents/emails/feb-10-email-to-alicante-es.pdf).
    - [Proof of sending via email](../../content/documents/emails/receipt-of-feb-email.pdf) -> this includes an extra short email I wrote about my concerns that Porsche would lie about me and proof that was sent also.

## The conservatory knows about my correspondence to the Generalitat

- When I go to the conservatory the following week, it is very clear that everyone knows what I have said in the email I sent to the Generalitat at the weekend, particularly with regards to Porsche, who is crying and moaning at reception with Gloria about something.
- It feels, again, set up and contrived.
- No one speaks to me about anything.

## Twitter starts to get more threatening

- I'm followed by a weird fake account, Mark Moseley, who is just like the other fake accounts that interact with me directly, but decidedly more violent in tone. He seems unhinged.
- He is, apparently, a homeless drug addict from Portland Oregon but he baits me with information only the people of Dénia would know.
- This goes on for a few weeks. I, again, think it is the trumpet teacher or someone related to him. He gives many details of things only he or his associates could know.
- I tell him I don't believe who he says he is. He posts an identification document for Mark Moseley from Portland Oregon.
- I guess now that it's another delegate, hacked, or stolen account.
- He tells me how he prayed incessantly for something, help, and I came along. It seemed reasonable to me, still does.
- He asks me would I die for him. I do not respond. He says he would die for me. 
- In a DM, he tries to recruit me to his honey trap organization. This is on February 20th.
- I refuse in no uncertain terms.
- I have a copy of [the whole DM here](../../content/images/threats/mark-moseley-mail-in-full.pdf).
- Joe Biden's worst nightmare is Trump, of course. The **trump**et teacher has always used trump as a trigger or signpost for me.
- At the end of this chat, when I refuse to sign up to whatever he wants me to do - he'd said using fake accounts to find lonely men looking for love, or something like this - he threatens me with violence.
- His message says: "I hope you find an excellent plastic surgeon for your face."

![Threat of violence from Mark Mosely account](../../content/images/threats/threat-1.png)
![Threat of violence from Mark Mosely account](../../content/images/threats/mark-mosely-tweet.png)

- He says something else threatening about me which I didn't save at the time.
- At the time of writing, Sunday 24th November, the account has been deleted and so I am unable to see his past messages live on Twitter.

![Threat of violence from Mark Mosely account](../../content/images/threats/threat-2.png)

- And there are some other threats around this from other accounts which are unsettling. An example:

![Threat of violence from Mark Mosely account](../../content/images/threats/threats-around-threats.png)

- Interestingly, it is only a few days previous, Wednesday 20th November 2024, that I checked this account and it was still live and posting.

![Account still live and posting just a few days ago](../../content/images/threats/threat-of-violence-ac-open-a-few-days-back.png)

- I consider that to demonstrate how hackers are still accessing everything I do online in more-or-less real time.
- Going back to the original threat, I consider the threat to be credible and to mean that someone may throw acid on my face.
- A lot of my Twitter pals suggest reporting to the police: https://x.com/search?q=(to%3A1frgvn)%20until%3A2024-02-21%20since%3A2024-02-19&src=typed_query&f=live.
- He has deleted the account now.

!!! danger "Hackers still active - November 2024"
    - My movements are still being tracked and I'm still being hacked extensively.
    - I believe they deleted the Mark Moseley account at exactly the time I plan to be writing about it.
    - It is highly likely they are reading this statement while I write it.

- Perhaps any deleted accounts or messages are salvageable in Twitter caches.
- I sent a copy of the threat to the Alicante directorate too, asking them if they would do something now.

![Threat of violence on Twitter](../../content/images/threats/threat-of-violence-twitter.png)

- There was, of course, no reply.
- I am starting to get seriously stressed and anxious now. And I'm scared too. 

## Guardia Civil

- I try to access the Guardia Civil webpage for reporting gender violence and cyber stalking. 
- The page fails to load at every attempt to access it. It's not a 404, or any normal error. It's a not connected to the internet error, except I am. 
- I literally cannot access any reporting pages on the Guardia Civil website at all.
- I know now I was blocked from accessing the Guardia Civil's gender violence and cyber stalking reporting line by hackers.
- This happens again when I try to access the European Union's human rights website and report there, after which I'm bombarded with fake account with titles related to "human rights".
- This may be [a message I sent them](../../content/documents/letters/possible-mail-to-the-GC.pdf) via an email address I found, I'm not sure now but the document I have is dated 20th February 2024.

## Policia Nacional

- Having been threatened with real violence, I (reluctantly I must say) go to report the gang stalking and everything to the police in Dénia the next morning.
- I take all my documentation in Spanish detailing the story so far, including all my communication with the Generalitat.
- The policeman who deals with me reads the two letters I wrote to Concha the June before, tells me there is no crime, and that I should go home.
- I have a stack of documentation I would like them to read, but they are not at all interested.
- I tell them, but these people are civil servants in charge of children. They tell me I need to take a civil case out against the conservatory.
- I explain I'm being hacked. They say, how can teachers at the conservatory hack you, they are musicians.
- I tell them about the threat I received online the night before. They read it and tell me, "oh, he can say that because he probably thinks you're ugly".
- I'm utterly flabbergasted, and leave.
- While I was there, a woman police officer was holding up her mobile phone as if she was filming me the whole time.
- I wondered if they knew exactly who I was and what was happening to me.

## European Court of Human Rights

- On 26th February, I contact the European Court of Human Rights.
- I have a similar experience to what happened when I tried to access the Guardia Civil cyber stalking and domestic violence pages.
- I'm unable to find information about how to report what's going on for me.
- I send a [message in a comment box](../../content/documents/letters/echr-message.pdf) instead, to which I never receive a reply.
- Later that day, I get followed by fake accounts related to human rights. This is just one of them.

![Human rights accounts](../../content/images/fake-accounts/human-rights-accs/Screenshot%202024-03-04%20at%2008.32.54.png)
![Human rights accounts](../../content/images/fake-accounts/human-rights-accs/Screenshot%202024-03-08%20at%2008.35.00.png)

!!! note 
    - The profile message: "WHAT THE UN HAS CALLED #CYBERTORTURE (A/HRC/43/49) #CYBERTORTURE IS BEING DONE TO ME. LINK TO COMPLAINTS PUBLISHED BY THE RAPPORTEUR FOR TORTURE, NILS MELZER".

## Searching for a security expert

- The cyber stalkers are mentioning the child sexual abuse I endured more and more.
- They post suggestions they have porn videos with me in them.
- I see photos and silhouettes of what looks like me as a child of 16, lying on a bed, naked. 
- I try to find a security expert who can search for these images online. 
- I actually talk to a person: Andy Clarke <andy.clarke@fact-uk.org.uk> about this.
- He said he was unable to help me.
