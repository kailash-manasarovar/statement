## Lourdes

- I spend two weeks in Lourdes.
- A snap election is called in the UK.
- An email comes round from the [Party of women](https://www.partyofwomen.org/) asking members to run for election.
- Something tells me I should run for election in the UK and I go for it.

### Transvestite nun

- The night before I leave for the UK, I go for a short drink on my way back to my hotel after prayers at the grotto.
- After a few minutes, three people walk in; two women, and a man, except the man is dressed as a nun.
- He has five-o'clock shadow and he is talking in a squeaky high voice.
- I'm horrified and [write to the Pope](../../content/documents/letters/Pope.pdf) about it.

## UK

- I spend the rest of June in the UK running my election campaign in Finchley and Golders Green.

![Barnet post](../../content/documents/barnet-post.png)

!!! info
    - With regards to my situation in Dénia, running for election was a game changer.
    - For anyone interested, here is my [election leaflet](../../content/documents/Katharine%20leaflet.pdf) which went out to 80,000 London constituents, twice, via Royal Mail.

### Social media and Paul

- I create a Facebook account for my election campaign.
- An old friend Paul Pompeus connects with me.
- He is exuberant and friendly.
- He sounds exactly like the person I used to know over twenty years before.
- He sends me messages fairly regularly on Facebook up until I see him again in January 2025.
- I reach out to a number of other people on Facebook, including all of Paul's family and their friends and family. They all ignore me.
- I assume it is because they are pro-trans or do not want to be associated with someone speaking up about the dangers of gender ideology.

## Continued stalking and health matters

- I'm stalked online constantly by hackers while I'm in the UK, and a conversation continues with them on DMs with fake accounts during this time. Copies available on request.
- I tell my new friends about the gypsy trumpeter I'm in love with.
- None of them are particularly impressed and I'm not surprised at that.
- Some of them seem to be trying to talk me out of it. Some seem to have background knowledge of what's been going on for me.
- I'm aware that everything I do online is seen by hackers. Everything.
- Electioneering is a social business and I drink alcohol most days.
- However, I feel no ill effects like I do when I am at home in Dénia. It's weird.
- In Dénia, I have frothy urine nearly every day. After about a week in Lourdes, this ceased.
- It starts up again when I go back to Dénia in July.

## Election campaign

### Barnet Post

- My dad reads my article in the Barnet Post and gets upset.
- He says, why didn't you tell me, a lot.
- I say everyone knew.
- Silence.
- Later, when drunk, he makes a joke about how many men have had me.
- He repeats the *why didn't you tell me* thing for nearly a year until I take a moment to point out a few obvious things out to him.
- In September 2025, I excitedly tell him there might be a new investigation.
- Silence. 
- Of course, he's worried about himself, never me.
- Pedo's always pick their victims wisely and will have always done their homework and family background checks.
- They never count on God though.

### Gang of adult men talking about getting their dicks out at Finchley Central tube station

- While handing out leaflets at Finchley Central tube one evening, a gang of about 8 men came to stand beside me. They spoke to me a little bit about their "male" group. They were weird. It was all very contrived.
- As I walked past them they were all talking about getting their dicks out.
- I told them no one wanted to see that.
- I believe they could be police now, they were that sort of men. 
- In retrospect I wonder if they were trying to scare me.

### An old friend

- One morning at East Finchley tube, I see an old friend from 1989 Geetha.
- She's never been my friend - she bullied me horribly since 1989 - but I'm happy to see her in any case.
- She doesn't have anything nice to say.
- She's seems nervous, her voice is shaking.
- She takes a photo with me and her, and leaves.
- I'm happy she came over to say hello and think nothing more of it.

### Winston May

!!! danger "Proof that criminal gangs in Dénia had connections with North London rape gangs, somehow"
    - During my election campaign, my little group of volunteers handed out leaflets in the constituency.
    - On Wednesday 3rd July, we were at Brent Cross tube station.
    - One of my volunteers stood very close to me and appeared to be trying to distract me all evening with continuous chatter. 
    - At one point, she stood extremely close and, being a very large lady, she blocked my view of the people walking into the station. She was sort of shouting in my ear at that moment, while I tried to ignore her.
    - It was exaggerated behavior and quite absurd. I was even more suspicious of this woman's intentions.
    - She left and only myself and one other volunteer was with me. We were standing at separate exits, fairly far apart from each other, but I could see him.
    - Shortly afterwards, a man with a small boy stumbled towards me through the station.
    - The man was black and he was wearing a yellow jumper with diamond checks and a cream chimney-sweep hat. 
    - The boy was arabic looking with dark skin.
    - The man was stumbling as he walked, he was very unbalanced. The little boy seemed to be leading him towards me.

    ![Winston May at Brent Cross](../../content/images/winston-brent-cross.png)

    - I recognized Winston May immediately; ringleader of the pedophile grooming gang in Tottenham that had raped and abused me repeatedly, and put me in porn, in the summer of 1989.
    - He look like he was out of his mind on drugs.
    - I offered him a leaflet and insisted he took one when he said he already had one. He tried to get away from me as I walked towards him.
    - Later, in the pub, I told my volunteer what I had seen. 
    - Incidentally, for some reason I felt I needed to change my will that day and did so.
    - My volunteer then told me a story that he had been sexually abused as a child when he was 7, in an African country, and that he had seen the abuser again when he was about 16 holding the hand of a young boy.
    - I think he was supposed to have told me his story before I told him mine.
    - Is this proof that the Dénia criminal porn gangs, obsessed with whatever film they had found of me after reading my [police statement in 2015](../early-years/2015.md#statement-to-the-metropolitan-police), together with their UK connections, found ways to continue to terrorize me in London as I was running for election?
    - Had I been receiving subliminal death threats online which triggered a will change?
    - It's difficult to understand exactly why this event happened, who would benefit, and how the Dénia criminal gangs could not be involved in some way.
    - Could this event have been set up by the police themselves; trying to terrorize a rape gang survivor out of politics?
    - Later, I remember my [dream from a month previous](may.md#dreaming-of-the-pedophile).

### Party of Women party

- There is a party in Islington held for Let Women Speak and the Party Of Women.
- It takes place the Saturday 29th June, the weekend before the general election.
- I go and meet many of the other candidates for election.
- So (Janet), my volunteer, is there.
- She came to help out at East Finchley festival.
- She flatters me a little, and buys me a drink, and says she'll be helping out the following week.
- A little bit later, I meet Beverley who is standing against Emily Thornberry.
- When I go to give Bev a hug to say hi, our cheeks brush.
- The softness of Bev's cheek skin is incredible, it's amazing, I'm blown away by the softness of her cheek.
- I'm so amazed at how soft her cheek felt I tell a few people about it, including So, and one other woman who I met at Madrid (can't remember her name - but she tried to create some negativity with me that night by telling me a story with no details about how people have been saying things, oh you'll find out, Kate something, she said... I wasn't impressed).
- Two weeks later, Posie Parker repeats everything this woman said to me, word for word, on a video.
- Anyway. 
- The way I felt about Beverley's soft cheek is proof, to me, that I was high that night on some sense-affecting substance, something either I was absorbing through my shampoo I brought over from Spain - likely to be the aphrodisiac they were feeding me - or with a top-up I had ingested that night without my knowledge.

### Speech at LWS

- At LWS in Hyde Park on 30th June, I make a speech.
- It's obvious I'm being discredited in the community. My past experience as a grooming gang survivor makes people uncomfortable, but there's more to it than that.
- When the video is posted on Twitter, the end part, including my speech is cut out.

![my speech](../../content/documents/speeches/my-speech.png)

!!! important
    - Running for election at the UK General Election in July 2024 for the Party of women was a game changer for me, quite possibly a life saving act.
    - In one of the first messages in our long communication from July and over August, the hacker said "well I wasn't expecting that" with regards to it.

#### My friend from Madrid

- Curiously, my friend from Madrid is there and she records my speech on her phone. I have a copy.
- She brings her 14-year-old nephew, who she tells me has ADHD.
- He does seem a little high; he just grins a lot and keeps falling asleep.
- The thing is, she had a 5-year-old nephew in 2006, the year I met her.
- She told me she had visited London with him at that time.
- This boy is supposed to be the same nephew, but he's 10 years too young!
- I find it suspicious.

### Volunteers not what they seem

!!! danger "Volunteer list"
    - I believe most of my "volunteers" were connected to Hazel and Sandra Smith in Dénia in some way, or bent coppers trying to silence me due to my rape-gang survivor status.
    - Here is a list of them:

        - Janet (calls herself So): constantly and extremely weirdly trying to distract me from campaigning. She gave me some items which may have contained poison and were certainly related to my history; a vile of holy water from St Valentine, a badge my dad wore, etc. She significantly runs distracting game on me at [Brent X tube](#winston-may) while they're setting up the Winston May event.

        ![Trannish inquisition](../../content/images/so-informer.png)

        - Steve Norman: lovely man from N2 who kept saying he had been involved in vivisection activity in the 80s which I took to mean he was probably a police informant of some sort as he was significantly involved in the [Winston May event](#winston-may) at Brent Cross tube, but now I believe he could also be connected to the criminal gangs of Dénia. Perhaps the two interested parties work together very closely.
        - Athena Norman: Steve's "wife", a trans-sexual man. I believed this set up to be a way to discredit me in the future. Steve gave a speech at Let Women Speak about "his wife" sometimes in 2024.
        - Wesley Aguilar: a man who was clearly embarrassed about something as he could not look me in the eye. Had he seen the child rape porn I was in? I suspect he works for the police, along with a bunch of other men that are Let Women Speak regulars... who I have been told will block newcomers from interacting with the established group at LWS.
        - Sandra: a woman I initially trusted but after something she said, and some [experiences with her sister Susan](../2025/march.md#let-women-speak-aberdeen), I suspect she must be connected to the Smiths via North London criminal gangs and possibly the police.
        - There were a few other volunteers who I did trust that I won't mention here.

- I've since told So I don't trust her. I was warned about her on an [email from Patricia](../../content/documents/emails/trish-warning-about-So.png) on December 8th, 2024 (a significant date for me as everyone knows).
- I told her I didn't trust her. She since changed her profile with a message to me.

![so profile](../../content/images/so-profile.png)

## No sexual arousal

- I am not sexually aroused at all this month in London at my family's home away from Dénia.
- However, I am high and extremely physically sensitive (a certain event makes me realize this).
- Looking back, I see that I am in a heightened state of consciousness during the whole month of June and into July.
- DMs with hackers reveal this.
- I believe the drugging is continuing via bathroom products most likely, but I'm too busy with the election to be sexually aroused and/or the social media sexual hypno-suggestions have dropped off because there's no spy-cams available for the gangs to cash in on.
- This may change as I have no choice but to move back to London in 2025.
