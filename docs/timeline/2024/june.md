## Lourdes

- I spend two weeks in Lourdes.
- A snap election is called in the UK.
- An email comes round from the [Party of Women](https://www.partyofwomen.org/) asking members to run for election.
- Something tells me I should run for election in the UK and I go for it.

## UK

- I spend the rest of June in the UK running my election campaign in Finchley and Golders Green.

!!! info
    - With regards to my situation in Denia, running for election was a game changer.
    - For anyone interested, here is my [election leaflet](../../content/documents/Katharine%20leaflet.pdf) which went out to 80,000 London constituents, twice, via Royal Mail.

### Novel additions

- There are a few interesting things that should go in the novel here, not least that I was stalked by an original grooming gang member from 1989 (the one they arrested) outside Brent Cross tube on 3rd July while handing out leaflets.
- Also, I'm stalked online constantly by hackers while I'm in the UK, and a conversation continues with them on DMs with fake accounts during this time.
- I tell my new friends about the gypsy trumpeter I'm in love with.
- None of them are particularly impressed and I'm not surprised at that.
- I'm aware that everything I do online is seen by hackers. Everything.

### Election campaign

- Electioneering is a social business and I drink alcohol most days.
- However, I feel no ill effects like I do when I am at home in DÃ©nia. It's weird.
- In Denia, I have frothy urine nearly every day. After about a week in Lourdes, this ceased.
- It starts up again when I go back to Denia in July.

### Speech at LWS

- At LWS in Hyde Park on 28th June, I make a speech.
- It's obvious I'm being discredited in the community. My past experience as a grooming gang survivor makes people uncomfortable, but there's more to it than that.
- When the video is posted on Twitter, the end part, including my speech is cut out.

!!! important
    - Running for election at the UK General Election in July 2024 for the Party of Women was a game changer for me, quite possibly a life saving act.
    - In one of the first messages in our long communication from July and over August, the hacker said "well I wasn't expecting that" with regards to it.

## No sexual arousal

- I am not sexually aroused at all this month away from Denia.
