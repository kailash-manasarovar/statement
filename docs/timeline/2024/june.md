## Lourdes

- I spend two weeks in Lourdes.
- A snap election is called in the UK.
- An email comes round from the [Party of Women](https://www.partyofwomen.org/) asking members to run for election.
- Something tells me I should run for election in the UK and I go for it.

## UK

- I spend the rest of June in the UK running my election campaign in Finchley and Golders Green.

!!! info
    - With regards to my situation in Denia, running for election was a game changer.
    - For anyone interested, here is my [election leaflet](../../content/documents/Katharine%20leaflet.pdf) which went out to 80,000 London constituents, twice, via Royal Mail.

### Novel additions

- There are a few interesting things that should go in the novel here, not least that I was stalked by an original grooming gang member from 1989 (the one they arrested) outside Brent Cross tube on 3rd July while handing out leaflets.
- Also, I'm stalked online constantly by hackers while I'm in the UK, and a conversation continues with them on DMs with fake accounts during this time.
- I tell my new friends about the gypsy trumpeter I'm in love with.
- None of them are particularly impressed and I'm not surprised at that.
- I'm aware that everything I do online is seen by hackers. Everything.

### Election campaign

- Electioneering is a social business and I drink alcohol most days.
- However, I feel no ill effects like I do when I am at home in DÃ©nia. It's weird.
- In Denia, I have frothy urine nearly every day. After about a week in Lourdes, this ceased.
- It starts up again when I go back to Denia in July.

!!! danger "Is this proof that stalkers from Denia did connect with child sex offenders in North London"
    - During my election campaign, I and a bunch of volunteers would hand leaflets out in North London.
    - On Wednesday 3rd July, I was handing out leaflets at Brent Cross tube station.
    - Only myself and one other volunteer was with me and we were standing far apart from each other.
    - At some point, I saw a man with a small boy of about 7.
    - The man was black and wearing a yellow jumper. The boy was arabic looking with dark skin.
    - The man was stumbling as he walked, he was very unbalanced, and the little boy seemed to be leading him towards my side.
    - I saw the man was Winston May, ringleader of the pedophile grooming gang in Tottenham that had raped and abused me repeatedly in the summer of 1989.
    - He look like he was out of his mind on drugs.
    - I offered him a leaflet and insisted he took one when he said he already had one. He tried to get away from me as I walked towards me.
    - Later, the volunteer who was with me told me a story that he had been sexually abused as a child when he was 7, in an African country, and that he had seen the abuser again when he was about 16 holding the hand of a young boy.
    - Is this proof that the Denia criminal porn gangs, obsessed with whatever film they had found of me after reading my statement online which they probably took copies of, and with their UK connections, found ways to continue to terrorize me in London as I was running for election?
    - It's difficult to understand exactly why this event happened, who would benefit, and how the Denia criminal gangs could not be involved in some way.

### Speech at LWS

- At LWS in Hyde Park on 28th June, I make a speech.
- It's obvious I'm being discredited in the community. My past experience as a grooming gang survivor makes people uncomfortable, but there's more to it than that.
- When the video is posted on Twitter, the end part, including my speech is cut out.

!!! important
    - Running for election at the UK General Election in July 2024 for the Party of Women was a game changer for me, quite possibly a life saving act.
    - In one of the first messages in our long communication from July and over August, the hacker said "well I wasn't expecting that" with regards to it.

## No sexual arousal

- I am not sexually aroused at all this month away from Denia.
