## Lourdes

- I spend two weeks in Lourdes.
- I have my laptop and I'm working from my hotel room.
- I visit the grotto every day to pray.
- I ask Mary to help me with the inexplicable and ferocious evil that surrounds me from all sides; at home in Dénia, online, and at work.
- She delivers, as usual.

### Polygon

- The extent of the hatred towards me is a little overwhelming.
- I feel that the constant persecution I'm experiencing at work cannot be unconnected to that which I've been experiencing in Dénia and online from Dénia cyber-stalkers.
- The energy is the same.
- At work, Paul Gebheim gives me an apparently impossible task.
- I decide to pull a *rabbit out of the hat* and show them how it's done.
- I do.
- They're all a bit surprised, and I literally never hear from anyone again about this excellent piece of work.
- Hans is even more aggressive in team meetings than he was previously, if that was at all possible.
- I'm still the lead.
- Anthony supports him.
- They both refuse to communicate with me. 
- They are literally ignoring the polite but firm messages I send them repeatedly.
- Who has told them it is OK to do this?
- These men aren't fools.
- Paul O'Leary ignores my pleas for help dealing with their insubordination.
- It's impossible to do the job I'm being paid for.

### UK General Election

- A snap general election is called in the UK.
- An email comes round from the [Party of Women](https://www.partyofwomen.org/) asking members to run.
- Something tells me I should apply to run for election in my constituency in the UK.
- I apply.
- I fly back to London from Toulouse for 24 hours to get the election forms in at Barnet Council on Friday 7th June.
- I believe Mary is telling me to stand for election given the timing, and what's been going on for me, and my fervent prayers for help at Lourdes.
- The criminals of Dénia and the wider porn-gang-controlled regions should have maybe taken a massive collective gulp, except they didn't at all because they know they are protected at the highest level of the land and beyond.
- Nevertheless, Mary's advice was sound, and running for election most certainly made me safer and better protected against the criminal porn-gangs overall.

### Party Of Women leaflet

- Here's my general election leaflet.

![Leaflet front-side](../../content/images/leaflet-1.jpg)
![Leaflet back-side](../../content/images/leaflet-2.jpg)

### Transvestite nun

- The night before I leave for the UK, Friday 14th June, I go for a short drink on my way back to my hotel after prayers at the grotto.
- After a few minutes, three people walk in; two women, and a man, except the man is dressed as a nun.
- He has five-o'clock shadow and he is talking in a high squeaky voice.

![Transvestite nun](../../content/images/transvestite-nun.png)

- He's a transvestite nun.
- I can hardly believe my eyes.
- I'm horrified and [I write to the Pope](../../content/documents/letters/Pope.pdf) about it.

??? tip "My letter to the Pope"
    Saturday June 15th 2024</br>
    Dear Pope Francis</br>
    I have been coming to Lourdes now since 2008 when Mary called me. A long story.</br>
    I ended up serving in the baths from 2012-17. I have just signed up to serve again this 
    year.</br>
    I’m not Catholic. My dad is.</br>
    The reason I’m writing to you is that I started to notice men masquerading as women in 
    the women’s section of the baths in 2014. They were usually Scottish.</br>
    There was also a man pretending to be a female doctor in Lourdes in 2015. Also from 
    Scotland.</br>
    Yesterday evening I noticed a French transvestite nun in the cafe I was having a drink in 
    after procession. He was putting that awful squeaky “woman’s” voice on that they do, 
    and surrounded by obsequious women.</br>
    I also noticed, on Twitter, a well-known and extremely litigious and vexatious transvestite 
    from the UK who has made relentlessly legal attacks on women posting his arrival at 
    Lourdes. I saw him later in a medical servers outfit.
    https://x.com/drljultra/status/1801720201085423675</br>
    Many many of these men have sexual abuse histories, particularly of minors, including 
    this one.
    https://x.com/ReduxxMag/status/1692260173069619599</br>
    Pope, the rise in numbers of men pretending to be women is due to the porn epidemic 
    alone.</br>
    They become so addicted to violent and degrading porn, needing more, and worse and 
    worse, that their mentally ill minds begin to seek their own selves as “women” for 
    subjects of their lust.</br>
    These men find ways to get close to vulnerable women and children as part of their fetish.</br>
    It seems we have unilaterally decided that these predominantly white, western, wealthy, 
    privileged men who need psychological help should be pandered to.</br>
    They have nothing to do with the gay community.</br>
    I’d like you to support #PartyOfWomen in the UK who is raising awareness of the 
    problem.</br>
    I’d also like you to do something about this in Lourdes where EXTREMELY vulnerable 
    people are now targets for porn fetishists.</br>
    Mary has undoubtedly given me the task of being Her voice with regards to this.</br>
    I attach a flyer for my political run in the election.</br>
    Please help protect your deeply vulnerable congregation.</br>
    Thank you.</br>
    Katharine Margaret Murphy

- I also tweet about it.

- And I get censored for using the word "tranny".

[![Tranny nun](../../content/tweets/june-2024/tranny-censored.jpg)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1801728894816370874)

- It sort of feels like porn is taking over the whole world.
- Or trying to.
- Running for office makes me confident and optimistic, again.

- I also want to wholly recommend standing for office to any woman being terrorized by men. It'll do a million times more to keep you safe than going to the police.

## Taking two-weeks vacation from Polygon

- Post-[Bali](may.md#bali), my team at Polygon has become unmanageable.
- Hans' behavior is so unbelievably rude, he should be fired on the spot.
- Due to, I believe at the time, no-one doing anything about Hans, Anthony had also become insubordinate.
- I now believe they were instructed to behave this way towards me. 
- I had to be got rid of. And quick.
- I wasn't to know any of this.
- I still had no idea I am an *international spy-cam sedated female-tech-colleague [switcheroo rape-porn star](../../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#four-distinct-men)* and wasn't to know this for over a year more.
- My job at Polygon had become impossible with my team refusing to do any work or respond to me whenever I tried to communicate with them.
- My manager Paul should have sorted it out immediately, but he didn't.
- My manager David should have sorted it out immediately, but he didn't.
- They've both had *months* to get on top of this.
- Are they also part of the conspiracy? 
- I believe at the time their utter failure to help me is because the tech is failing yet again and they're too busy.
- The situation is getting really impossible to deal with and I don't know what to do.
- So, I fight like mad to get two weeks vacation so I can run a general election campaign instead of just being a paper-candidate.
- It would be that, or sitting doing nothing anyway because of my team's insubordination.
- Polygon management's lack of will to help me, or intention to not help me, was a total God-send in many ways because I could take the time off and run my election campaign instead.
- Delicious ironies.
- I reach out to Miriam in Spanish HR to ask for two weeks off, but she also deflects and ignores.
- Eventually, after much badgering and complaints about Hans and Anthony, they give me the time off.
- I start thinking about what I can do about this horrific and untenable work situation.
- I'm certain they want me to leave, but I love my job and have no intention of leaving.
- Just like I felt about studying the piano at the conservatory and being viciously hounded out there too.
- Coincidence? I think not.

## The UK General Election

- I spend the rest of June in the UK running my general election campaign for Finchley and Golders Green.
- The Barnet Post runs an advertisement for all the candidates and I supply a short introduction to myself and why I'm standing.

[![Barnet post](../../content/documents/barnet-post.png)](https://barnetpost.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Barnet-Post-July-2024.pdf)

??? quote "There is a war on women and I’m here to fight it"
    I am Katharine Margaret Murphy and I am standing as the Party Of Women candidate for election in Finchley & Golders Green because there is a war on women and children and I’m here to fight it.</br>
    </br>
    I am a grooming-gang/child-sexual-abuse survivor who was filmed and raped while drugged unconscious in the late 80s. If I had been born 30 years later, I would have sought refuge     in gender ideology.</br>
    </br>
    I didn’t know much about the “transing” of children until I volunteered with Childline as a counsellor. I was horrified to discover I was expected to tacitly support children’s delusions 
    about their sex and say things to them that could convince them to begin a lifelong medical journey which may include sterilization or mutilation.</br>
    </br>
    Similarly worrying, trans ideology allows grown men with sexual fetishes entry to women’s and girls private spaces and everyone is terrified to tell the truth about it.</br>
    </br>
    I am standing for the Party Of Women to make sure that people can safely say the following     without fear of being arrested:</br>
    </br>
    • No woman has a penis;</br>
    • No man has a vagina;</br>
    • There is no such thing as “non-binary”;</br>
    • “Transitioning” children is abuse.</br>
    </br>
    I look forward to the return of:</br>
    </br>
    • No men in women’s sports;</br>
    • No men in women’s jails;</br>
    • No perverts or porn addicts in women’s, children’s, and vulnerable people’s private spaces, especially in hospitals, schools, daycare, and end-of-life care;</br>
    • No trans invasion of gay and lesbian spaces.</br>
    </br>
    I stand for truth and common sense.</br>

!!! info
    - With regards to my situation in Dénia, running for election was a game changer.
    - For anyone interested, here is my [election leaflet](../../content/documents/Katharine%20leaflet.pdf) which went out to 80,000 London constituents, twice, via Royal Mail.

### Male aggression begins

- Constant.

### Social media and Paul

- I create a Facebook account for my election campaign.
- An old friend Paul Pompeus connects with me.
- He is exuberant and friendly.
- He sounds exactly like the person I used to know over twenty years before.
- He sends me messages fairly regularly on Facebook up until I see him again in January 2025.
- I reach out to a number of other people on Facebook, including all of Paul's family and their friends and family. They all ignore me.
- I assume it is because they are pro-trans or do not want to be associated with someone speaking up about the dangers of gender ideology.

## Continued stalking and health matters

- I'm stalked online constantly by hackers while I'm in the UK, and a conversation continues with them on DMs with fake accounts during this time. Copies available on request.
- I tell my new friends about the gypsy trumpeter I'm in love with.
- None of them are particularly impressed and I'm not surprised at that.
- Some of them seem to be trying to talk me out of it. Some seem to have background knowledge of what's been going on for me.
- I'm aware that everything I do online is seen by hackers. Everything.
- Electioneering is a social business and I drink alcohol most days.
- However, I feel no ill effects like I do when I am at home in Dénia. It's weird.
- In Dénia, I have frothy urine nearly every day. After about a week in Lourdes, this ceased.
- It starts up again when I go back to Dénia in July.

### Continued drugging

- So I don't get clear and remember the switcheroo.

## Election campaign

- The most exhilarating time of my life.

### Barnet Post

- My dad reads my article in the Barnet Post and gets upset.
- He says, why didn't you tell me, a lot.
- I say everyone knew.
- Silence.
- Later, when drunk, he makes a joke about how many men have had me.
- He repeats the *why didn't you tell me* thing for nearly a year until I take a moment to point out a few obvious things out to him.
- In September 2025, I excitedly tell him there might be a new investigation.
- Silence. 
- Of course, he's worried about himself, never me.
- Pedo's always pick their victims wisely and will have always done their homework and family background checks.
- They never count on God though.

### Gang of adult men talking about getting their dicks out at Finchley Central tube station

- While handing out leaflets at Finchley Central tube one evening, a gang of about 8 men came to stand beside me. They spoke to me a little bit about their "male" group. They were weird. It was all very contrived.
- As I walked past them they were all talking about getting their dicks out.
- I told them no one wanted to see that.
- I believe they could be police now, they were that sort of men. 
- In retrospect I wonder if they were trying to scare me.

### An old friend

- One morning at East Finchley tube while handing out leaflets, I see an old friend that was around when the rape-gang got hold of me in 1989, Geetha.
- She's never been my friend - she bullied me horribly on three different occasions from 1980 including viciously after the rape-gang thing. 
- I'm happy to see her in any case.
- She doesn't have anything nice to say to me.
- She's seems nervous, her voice is shaking.
- She takes a photo of me and her, and leaves.
- I'm happy she came over to say hello and think nothing more of it.

### Winston May

!!! danger "Proof that criminal gangs in Dénia had connections with North London rape gangs, somehow"
    - During my election campaign, my little group of volunteers handed out leaflets in the constituency.
    - On Wednesday 3rd July, we were at Brent Cross tube station.
    - One of my volunteers stood very close to me and appeared to be trying to distract me all evening with continuous chatter. 
    - At one point, she stood extremely close and, being a very large lady, she blocked my view of the people walking into the station. She was sort of shouting in my ear at that moment, while I tried to ignore her.
    - It was exaggerated behavior and quite absurd. I was even more suspicious of this woman's intentions.
    - She left and only myself and one other volunteer was with me. We were standing at separate exits, fairly far apart from each other, but I could see him.
    - Shortly afterwards, a man with a small boy stumbled towards me through the station.
    - The man was black and he was wearing a yellow jumper with diamond checks and a cream chimney-sweep hat. 
    - The boy was arabic looking with dark skin.
    - The man was stumbling as he walked, he was very unbalanced. The little boy seemed to be leading him towards me.

    ![Winston May at Brent Cross](../../content/images/winston-brent-cross.png)

    - I recognized Winston May immediately; ringleader of the pedophile grooming gang in Tottenham that had raped and abused me repeatedly, and put me in porn, in the summer of 1989.
    - He look like he was out of his mind on drugs.
    - I offered him a leaflet and insisted he took one when he said he already had one. He tried to get away from me as I walked towards him.
    - Later, in the pub, I told my volunteer what I had seen. 
    - Incidentally, for some reason I felt I needed to change my will that day and did so.
    - My volunteer then told me a story that he had been sexually abused as a child when he was 7, in an African country, and that he had seen the abuser again when he was about 16 holding the hand of a young boy.
    - I think he was supposed to have told me his story before I told him mine.
    - Is this proof that the Dénia criminal porn gangs, obsessed with whatever film they had found of me after reading my [police statement in 2015](../early-years/2015.md#statement-to-the-metropolitan-police), together with their UK connections, found ways to continue to terrorize me in London as I was running for election?
    - Had I been receiving subliminal death threats online which triggered a will change?
    - It's difficult to understand exactly why this event happened, who would benefit, and how the Dénia criminal gangs could not be involved in some way.
    - Could this event have been set up by the police themselves; trying to terrorize a rape gang survivor out of politics?
    - Later, I remember my [dream from a month previous](may.md#dreaming-of-the-pedophile).

### Party of Women party

- There is a party in Islington held for Let Women Speak and the Party Of Women.
- It takes place the Saturday 29th June, the weekend before the general election.
- I go and meet many of the other candidates for election.
- So (Janet), my volunteer, is there.
- She came to help out at East Finchley festival.
- She flatters me a little, and buys me a drink, and says she'll be helping out the following week.
- A little bit later, I meet Beverley who is standing against Emily Thornberry.
- When I go to give Bev a hug to say hi, our cheeks brush.
- The softness of Bev's cheek skin is incredible, it's amazing, I'm blown away by the softness of her cheek.
- I'm so amazed at how soft her cheek felt I tell a few people about it, including So, and one other woman who I met at Madrid (can't remember her name - but she tried to create some negativity with me that night by telling me a story with no details about how people have been saying things, oh you'll find out, Kate something, she said... I wasn't impressed).
- Two weeks later, Posie Parker repeats everything this woman said to me, word for word, on a video.
- Anyway. 
- The way I felt about Beverley's soft cheek is proof, to me, that I was high that night on some sense-affecting substance, something either I was absorbing through my shampoo I brought over from Spain - likely to be the aphrodisiac they were feeding me - or with a top-up I had ingested that night without my knowledge.
- I believe it must have been a low-dose LSD or mushroom-type substance.

### Speech at LWS

- At LWS in Hyde Park on 30th June, I make a speech.
- It's obvious I'm being discredited in the community. My past experience as a grooming gang survivor makes people uncomfortable, but there's more to it than that.
- When the video is posted on Twitter, the end part, including my speech is cut out.

![my speech](../../content/documents/speeches/my-speech.png)

!!! important
    - Running for election at the UK General Election in July 2024 for the Party of women was a game changer for me, quite possibly a life saving act.
    - In one of the first messages in our long communication from July and over August, the hacker said "well I wasn't expecting that" with regards to it.

#### My friend from Madrid

- Curiously, my friend from Madrid is there and she records my speech on her phone. I have a copy.
- She brings her 14-year-old nephew, who she tells me has ADHD.
- He does seem a little high; he just grins a lot and keeps falling asleep.
- The thing is, she had a 5-year-old nephew in 2006, the year I met her.
- She told me she had visited London with him at that time.
- This boy is supposed to be the same nephew, but he's 10 years too young!
- I find it suspicious.

### Volunteers not what they seem

!!! danger "Volunteer list"
    - I believe most of my "volunteers" were connected to Hazel and Sandra Smith in Dénia in some way, or bent coppers trying to silence me due to my rape-gang survivor status.
    - Here is a list of them:

        - Janet (calls herself So): constantly and extremely weirdly trying to distract me from campaigning. She gave me some items which may have contained poison and were certainly related to my history; a vile of holy water from St Valentine, a badge my dad wore, etc. She significantly runs distracting game on me at [Brent X tube](#winston-may) while they're setting up the Winston May event.

        ![Trannish inquisition](../../content/images/so-informer.png)

        - Steve Norman: lovely man from N2 who kept saying he had been involved in vivisection activity in the 80s which I took to mean he was probably a police informant of some sort as he was significantly involved in the [Winston May event](#winston-may) at Brent Cross tube, but now I believe he could also be connected to the criminal gangs of Dénia. Perhaps the two interested parties work together very closely.
        - Athena Norman: Steve's "wife", a trans-sexual man. I believed this set up to be a way to discredit me in the future. Steve gave a speech at Let Women Speak about "his wife" sometimes in 2024.
        - Wesley Aguilar: a man who was clearly embarrassed about something as he could not look me in the eye. Had he seen the child rape porn I was in? I suspect he works for the police, along with a bunch of other men that are Let Women Speak regulars... who I have been told will block newcomers from interacting with the established group at LWS.
        - Sandra: a woman I initially trusted but after something she said, and some [experiences with her sister Susan](../2025/march.md#let-women-speak-aberdeen), I suspect she must be connected to the Smiths via North London criminal gangs and possibly the police.
        - There were a few other volunteers who I did trust that I won't mention here.

- I've since told So I don't trust her. I was warned about her on an [email from Patricia](../../content/documents/emails/trish-warning-about-So.png) on December 8th, 2024 (a significant date for me as everyone knows).
- I told her I didn't trust her. She since changed her profile with a message to me.

![so profile](../../content/images/so-profile.png)

## No sexual arousal

- I am not sexually aroused at all this month in London at my family's home away from Dénia.
- However, I am high and extremely physically sensitive (a certain event makes me realize this).
- Looking back, I see that I am in a heightened state of consciousness during the whole month of June and into July.
- DMs with hackers reveal this.
- I believe the drugging is continuing via bathroom products most likely, but I'm too busy with the election to be sexually aroused and/or the social media sexual hypno-suggestions have dropped off because there's no spy-cams available for the gangs to cash in on.
- This may change as I have no choice but to move back to London in 2025.

[![Spy cams in London in 2025](../../content/tweets/spy-cams-in-london.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1926266246925795504)

## Telling my brother at the White Lion

- I take my brother out to dinner at the White Lion in N2 and tell him everything.
- I had told my brother everything I knew in June 2024 about what was going on for me and how much danger I was in. 
- We were tracked in the pub at that time by *operatives*, police I expect, or criminal gangs, or both probably.
