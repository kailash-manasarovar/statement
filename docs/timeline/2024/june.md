## Lourdes

- I spend two weeks in Lourdes.
- A snap election is called in the UK.
- An email comes round from the [Party of women](https://www.partyofwomen.org/) asking members to run for election.
- Something tells me I should run for election in the UK and I go for it.

## UK

- I spend the rest of June in the UK running my election campaign in Finchley and Golders Green.

!!! info
    - With regards to my situation in Dénia, running for election was a game changer.
    - For anyone interested, here is my [election leaflet](../../content/documents/Katharine%20leaflet.pdf) which went out to 80,000 London constituents, twice, via Royal Mail.

## Continued stalking and health matters

- I'm stalked online constantly by hackers while I'm in the UK, and a conversation continues with them on DMs with fake accounts during this time. Copies available on request.
- I tell my new friends about the gypsy trumpeter I'm in love with.
- None of them are particularly impressed and I'm not surprised at that.
- I'm aware that everything I do online is seen by hackers. Everything.
- Electioneering is a social business and I drink alcohol most days.
- However, I feel no ill effects like I do when I am at home in Dénia. It's weird.
- In Dénia, I have frothy urine nearly every day. After about a week in Lourdes, this ceased.
- It starts up again when I go back to Dénia in July.

## Election campaign

### Gang of adult men talking about getting their dicks out at Finchley Central tube station

- While handing out leaflets at Finchley Central tube one evening, a gang of about 8 men came to stand beside me. They spoke to me a little bit about their "male" group. They were weird. It was all very contrived.
- As I walked past them they were all talking about getting their dicks out.
- I told them no one wanted to see that.
- I believe they could be police now, they were that sort of men. 
- In retrospect I wonder if they were trying to scare me.

### Winston May

!!! danger "Proof that criminal gangs in Dénia had connections with North London rape gangs, somehow"
    - During my election campaign, my little group of volunteers handed out leaflets in the constituency.
    - On Wednesday 3rd July, we were at Brent Cross tube station.
    - One of my volunteers stood very close to me and appeared to be trying to distract me all evening with continuous chatter. 
    - At one point, she stood extremely close and, being a very large lady, she blocked my view of the people walking into the station. She was sort of shouting in my ear at that moment, while I tried to ignore her.
    - It was exaggerated behavior and quite absurd. I was even more suspicious of this woman's intentions.
    - She left and only myself and one other volunteer was with me. We were standing at separate exits, fairly far apart from each other, but I could see him.
    - At some point, I saw a man with a small boy coming from my volunteers direction.
    - The man was black and he was wearing a yellow jumper with diamond checks and a cream chimney-sweep hat. 
    - The boy was arabic looking with dark skin.
    - He was stumbling as he walked, he was very unbalanced. The little boy seemed to be leading him towards me.

    ![Winston May at Brent Cross](../../content/images/winston-brent-cross.png)

    - I recognized Winston May immediately; ringleader of the pedophile grooming gang in Tottenham that had raped and abused me repeatedly, and put me in porn, in the summer of 1989.
    - He look like he was out of his mind on drugs.
    - I offered him a leaflet and insisted he took one when he said he already had one. He tried to get away from me as I walked towards him.
    - Later, in the pub, I told my volunteer what I had seen. 
    - Incidentally, for some reason I felt I needed to change my will that day and did so.
    - My volunteer then told me a story that he had been sexually abused as a child when he was 7, in an African country, and that he had seen the abuser again when he was about 16 holding the hand of a young boy.
    - I think he was supposed to have told me his story before I told him mine.
    - Is this proof that the Dénia criminal porn gangs, obsessed with whatever film they had found of me after reading my [police statement in 2015](../early-years/2015.md#statement-to-the-metropolitan-police), together with their UK connections, found ways to continue to terrorize me in London as I was running for election?
    - Had I been receiving subliminal death threats online which triggered a will change?
    - It's difficult to understand exactly why this event happened, who would benefit, and how the Dénia criminal gangs could not be involved in some way.
    - Could this event have been set up by the police themselves; trying to terrorize a rape gang survivor out of politics?
    - Later, I remember my [dream about Winston M from May](may.md#dreaming-of-the-pedophile).

### Speech at LWS

- At LWS in Hyde Park on 28th June, I make a speech.
- It's obvious I'm being discredited in the community. My past experience as a grooming gang survivor makes people uncomfortable, but there's more to it than that.
- When the video is posted on Twitter, the end part, including my speech is cut out.

!!! important
    - Running for election at the UK General Election in July 2024 for the Party of women was a game changer for me, quite possibly a life saving act.
    - In one of the first messages in our long communication from July and over August, the hacker said "well I wasn't expecting that" with regards to it.

### Volunteers not what they seem

!!! danger "Volunteer list"
    - I believe most of my "volunteers" were connected to Hazel and Sandra Smith in Dénia in some way. Here is a list of them:
        - Janet (calls herself So): constantly and extremely weirdly trying to distract me from campaigning. She gave me some items which may have contained poison.
        - Steve Norman: lovely man from N2 who kept saying he had been involved in vivisection activity in the 80s which I took to mean he was probably a police informant of some sort, but now I believe he was connected to the criminal gangs of Dénia.
        - Athena Norman: Steve's "wife", a trans-sexual man. I believed this set up to be a way to discredit me in the future.
        - Wesley Aguilar: a man who was clearly embarrassed about something as he could not look me in the eye. Had he seen the child rape porn I was in?
        - There were a few other volunteers who I did trust that I won't mention here.

- I've since told So I don't trust her. I was warned about her on an [email from Patricia](../../content/documents/emails/trish-warning-about-So.png) on December 8th, 2024 (a significant date for me as everyone knows.)
- I told her I didn't trust her. She since changed her profile with a message to me.

## No sexual arousal

- I am not sexually aroused at all this month away from Dénia.
