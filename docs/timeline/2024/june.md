## Lourdes

- I spend two weeks in Lourdes.
- A snap election is called in the UK.
- An email comes round from the [Party of Women](https://www.partyofwomen.org/) asking members to run for election.
- Something tells me I should run for election in the UK and I go for it.

## UK

- I spend the rest of June in the UK running my election campaign in Finchley and Golders Green.

!!! info
    - With regards to my situation in Denia, running for election was a game changer.
    - For anyone interested, here is my [election leaflet](../../content/documents/Katharine%20leaflet.pdf) which went out to 80,000 London constituents, twice, via Royal Mail.

## Continued stalking and health matters

- I'm stalked online constantly by hackers while I'm in the UK, and a conversation continues with them on DMs with fake accounts during this time. Copies available on request.
- I tell my new friends about the gypsy trumpeter I'm in love with.
- None of them are particularly impressed and I'm not surprised at that.
- I'm aware that everything I do online is seen by hackers. Everything.
- Electioneering is a social business and I drink alcohol most days.
- However, I feel no ill effects like I do when I am at home in DÃ©nia. It's weird.
- In Denia, I have frothy urine nearly every day. After about a week in Lourdes, this ceased.
- It starts up again when I go back to Denia in July.

## Election campaign

### Gang of adult men talking about getting their dicks out at Finchley Central tube station

- While handing out leaflets at Finchley Central tube one evening, a gang of about 8 men came to stand beside me. They spoke to me a little bit about their "male" group. They were weird. It was all very contrived.
- As I walked past them they were all talking about getting their dicks out.
- I told them no one wanted to see that.
- I believe they could be police now, they were that sort of men. 
- In retrospect I wonder if they were trying to scare me.

### Winston May

!!! danger "Is this proof that stalkers from Denia did connect with child sex offenders in North London"
    - During my election campaign, I and a bunch of volunteers would hand leaflets out in North London.
    - On Wednesday 3rd July, I was handing out leaflets at Brent Cross tube station.
    - Only myself and one other volunteer was with me and we were standing far apart from each other.
    - At some point, I saw a man with a small boy of about 7.
    - The man was black and wearing a yellow jumper and cream chimney-sweep hat. The boy was arabic looking with dark skin.
    - The man was stumbling as he walked, he was very unbalanced, and the little boy seemed to be leading him towards me.
    - I saw the man was Winston May, ringleader of the pedophile grooming gang in Tottenham that had raped and abused me repeatedly, and put me in porn, in the summer of 1989.
    - He look like he was out of his mind on drugs.
    - I offered him a leaflet and insisted he took one when he said he already had one. He tried to get away from me as I walked towards him.
    - Later, the volunteer who was with me told me a story that he had been sexually abused as a child when he was 7, in an African country, and that he had seen the abuser again when he was about 16 holding the hand of a young boy.
    - Is this proof that the Denia criminal porn gangs, obsessed with whatever film they had found of me after reading my statement online which they probably took copies of, and with their UK connections, found ways to continue to terrorize me in London as I was running for election?
    - It's difficult to understand exactly why this event happened, who would benefit, and how the Denia criminal gangs could not be involved in some way.

### Volunteers not what they seem

!!! danger "Volunteer list"
    - I believe most of my "volunteers" were connected to Hazel and Sandra Smith in Denia in some way. Here is a list of them:
        - Janet (calls herself So): constantly and extremely weirdly trying to distract me from campaigning. She gave me some items which may have contained poison.
        - Steve: lovely man from N2 who kept saying he had been involved in vivisection activity in the 80s which I took to mean he was probably a police informant of some sort, but now I believe he was connected to the criminal gangs of Denia.
        - Athena: Steve's "wife", a trans-sexual man. I believed this set up to be a way to discredit me in the future.
        - Wesley Aguilar: a man who was clearly embarrassed about something as he could not look me in the eye. Had he seen the child rape porn I was in?
        - There were a few other volunteers who I did trust that I won't mention here.

### Speech at LWS

- At LWS in Hyde Park on 28th June, I make a speech.
- It's obvious I'm being discredited in the community. My past experience as a grooming gang survivor makes people uncomfortable, but there's more to it than that.
- When the video is posted on Twitter, the end part, including my speech is cut out.

!!! important
    - Running for election at the UK General Election in July 2024 for the Party of Women was a game changer for me, quite possibly a life saving act.
    - In one of the first messages in our long communication from July and over August, the hacker said "well I wasn't expecting that" with regards to it.

## No sexual arousal

- I am not sexually aroused at all this month away from Denia.
