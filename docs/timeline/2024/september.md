## Letters

- I send as many letters as I can while I'm in France.
- I add photos that he has sent to me too, even thought I'm not sure if they are legit or not.
- Certainly the screenshot of the concert I see in [June 2023 on Youtube](../2023/june.md#youtube) is legit.

## Who Is This?

- I start a Twitter hashtag #WhoIsThis and post some of the pics I've been seeing of women who look like they're being abused.
- Trish Penny sends an email around with the subject "Who Is This".
- I consider this some confirmation that Trish knows exactly what is going on.

- This sparks off some conversation between us and I get a chance to express my anger at Chris BJ.
