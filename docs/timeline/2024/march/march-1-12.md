# March 1st-12th 2024

## Monday 4th March chamber music

- Esteve brings us a new song with two cats meowing at each other, Rossini's cat duet.
- The irony is not lost on me.
- I wonder if Esteve knows I am suffering from intense criminal gang stalking and violent harassment of my psycho/emotional state?

## Tuesday 5th March piano lesson

### An inspector calls

- I arrive at my piano lesson and, after a minute or two, all of a sudden, a woman enters the classroom.
- She is a large dark curly-haired woman of about 50 years old and I would recognize her again.

![An inspector calls from the GV](../../content/images/inspector.png)

- Paqui explains the woman is an *inspector* from the Generalitat and she is here to help me.
- I feel like it's probably an ambush and put my phone on record.
- Paqui reiterates that the woman is here to help me with everything that's going on, and I understand that to mean because of how I previously told her I'm stressed because I'm being terrorized by Domingo and his mates. 
- The woman talks about having to get the police involved.
- I am delighted and express gratitude because something is finally happening after nearly two years of abuse instigated by a teacher, Domingo the piano teacher.
- I ask her why the Generalitat has not replied to any of my emails or letters.
- She says they did but they not have my street address!
- She tells me they did reply in December but it came back to them because they did not have my street address. This is ridiculous.
- I mention that I sent the notices by email and that my address is in the systems and that they could have asked, or informed me, at any time.
- She ignores me. These are the documents she showed me.

    - [Document receipt copy with date info](../../content/documents/gv/8.%20Receipt%20date%20received%205%20March%20at%20piano%20lesson.JPG).
    - [The document receipt](../../content/documents/gv/8.%20Receipt%20of%20something%20from%20the%20Generalitat%201%205%20March%202023.jpeg).
    - [A part of the document they apparently sent](../../content/documents/gv/8.%20Receipt%20of%20something%20from%20the%20Generalitat%202%205%20March%202023.jpeg).

- Paqui looks nervous.
- I ask her for the content of the letter they sent which I do not see in the documents she has.
- The woman's tone is not at all friendly towards me. She says, oh that doesn't matter now.
- She starts saying everything is too public now and that the police will need to be called.
- I say thank God, I have been stalked for nearly 2 years, I wrote to the GV numerous times about this horrible situation where a student is being terrorized by teachers, and everyone ignored me so I would welcome the police getting involved.
- The woman is a bit taken aback, Paqui is very nervous, but she then goes on to reiterate that I have been saying things online and the police must be called.
- She starts asking me questions about what I'm saying on Twitter.
- I find it very threatening. 
- I tell her I don't like the way she is talking to me, and say that I'm not speaking to her further without a lawyer present.
- The woman leaves. I never hear from her or anyone else from the Generalitat again until I receive a letter in April after I have left my studies due to becoming afraid for my life.

## Wednesday 6th March

### Stolen iPad

- I can't find my iPad and I believe it is stolen.
- I ask Gloria at the conservatory if anyone has handed in an iPad.
- She becomes extremely concerned about it and we go looking around the building.
- She is really upset about the thought an iPad might have been stolen. I find it astonishing.
- Her concern for my iPad far extends any concern she might have had for me, a student, being terrorized by Domingo, a teacher, and his associates, which includes her of course.
- When we are upstairs, I speak to her about what's going on privately. I tell her I can't believe how it just goes on and on.
- She looks scared. She is shaking and her voice is trembling.
- I tell her "you know it's not just me they're looking at online". An alarmed flash crosses her face.
- She suggests I go and talk to Enric Gil who is works at the town hall in the capacity of welcoming foreign people who have just moved to the area.

### Enric Gil

- I go to see Enric. I know him already from  when I lived in Dénia previously in 2006-9, and we had friends in common.
- I tell him everything. 
- As I start to mention the threats from Domingo he shuts me down.
- He says I should see the Dénia local police who have a division for gender violence.
- We go outside.
- I'm speaking to him and he's laughing at me while I do. I wonder if someone is behind me making faces or playing the fool. It's unsettling.
- He goes to talk to a local police officer and comes back.
- He says I cannot raise anything with them as I don't have a partner and they only deal with male violence when it occurs within a partnership.

### Trying to find help

- I don't know what to do, where to turn, who to ask for help.
- The Policia Nacional are disinterested, the local police don't want to know, the Generalitat is suggesting they are going to have *me* arrested for being a victim of cyber stalking and gang stalking and talking about it on Twitter. It's overwhelmingly stressful.
- I have searched for a human rights lawyer and send some random emails to try and get help.
- I was able to finally communicate with the ECHR when I was in Brussels in July: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1811523447123558841.

!!! warning
    - The stress levels are really intensifying during this period.

### A donation to a twitter account

- I make a £100 donation to a Twitter account online: https://x.com/latsot.
- This is a well known account in the UK feminist communities and is even supported by https://niaendingviolence.org.uk/.
- At the very moment I make the donation, he posts this: https://x.com/latsot/status/1765118778684342347.
- A fake account comments on being jealous.
- I'm so concerned about this, I look up Rob Smith's websites, and I see he does an awful lot of fundraising but there are no pictures of him doing anything at all.
- I contact nia about it I'm so concerned but they're convinced he's legit.
- I wonder if Rob Smith is connected to Sandra and Hazel Smith.

### Carmen Cano

- Right after this, a fake account whizzes by on likes with the name Carmen Cano.
- I can only assume it is a message from someone to make me think Carmen Cano is behind the scam.
- Carmen Cano being Domingo the piano teacher's sister.

![Carmen Cano](../../content/images/fake-accounts/carmen-cano.png)

### Scarfs from the lady who knows who I am

- I buy some scarves from a shop in the Calle La Mar, could be Vintage Ibiza.
- It's run by a polish woman who is very nice.
- We chat and I tell her I'm studying piano at the conservatory.
- She becomes very embarrassed and is unable to speak to me. She knows who I am.
- This shop had a picture in the window of Frida Khalo for months.
- Often, in the Google search results for `@jctot19` there were pictures of Frida Khalo and references to the trumpet teacher having another girlfriend.
- Ridiculous, I know.
- Amazing that the people of Dénia would put so much effort into all this, and it must have cost a lot of time, effort, and money to keep it going. 
- I now wonder if they were perhaps making more money than they were spending from either:
    - Mass voyeurism on social media of "hunted" or targeted women in Spain.
    - Mass voyeurism of women being filmed on hidden cameras in their homes, possibly amateur porn networks, something I often saw in my Google results.
    - Mass voyeurism of people who enjoy watching others suffer.

## Thursday 7th March

### Hackers reference payments I have made

- I start to see references to payments I have made online, including exact figures, and sometimes even mentions of the payee.
- One was in reference to a charity gift I gave to a Twitter account around that time, after which I receive a follow from a fake account that was "jealous".
- Shortly after this, another remarkable set of tweet references were related to a monetary gift I had sent to my monk friend of 333 euros at Christmas.
- As you may remember, they refer to the monk as "panda".

![Panda 333](../../content/tweets/panda-333-1.png)
![Panda 333](../../content/tweets/panda-333-3.png)
![Panda 333](../../content/tweets/panda-333-4.png)
![Panda 333](../../content/tweets/panda-333-5.png)

- I'm pretty sure the `@crispolata` account is Hazel or Sandra Smith, or one of their associates.

#### Fake accounts reference payments I have made online

- I sent a financial a gift to my friend for Christmas.
- My friend is a Tibetan monk and [he visited me in September 2023](../2023/september.md#the-tibetan-monk-visits) when I was being severely terrorized online and in-person in the town.
- Fake accounts post the payment amount to me, while I'm in the middle of an X thread with a [stalker account about "pandas"](march.md#thursday-7th-march).

### Change root password

- I change the root password on my laptop.
- The router is off.
- The following morning, Friday 8th March, half of my new root password appears on a fake account's profile message.

## Friday 8th March

### Report hacking to work

- I opened a Twitter account for work on my work laptop, I can't remember when.
- Immediately, I was followed by accounts with names related to the gang stalking.
- I filed it away, it was too much to deal with at that moment, although I did raise a ticket with IT at one point when I saw something weird.
- With everything going on, I realize it's time to tell the security department at my work I think I've been hacked.
- Gordon Bishop of Polygon Labs investigates. 
- He asks me to access 1.1.1.1 on my browser. What he's expecting to happen, doesn't happen. 
- He's expecting to see the WARP webpage but, instead, we get the login page for the network router.

![Router login](../../content/images/hacked-work-laptop/router-login.png)

- He also sees some weird stuff with Mac certificates.

![Mac certificates](../../content/images/hacked-work-laptop/weird-issues-with-certificates.png)

- He asks me to check on FireFox too.

![Firefox security alert](../../content/images/hacked-work-laptop/hacking-alert.png)

!!! tip
    - The screenshots above are from my work laptop.

- He says this is enough evidence of hacking through the router for them to lock me down and reformat my laptop.
- I have to work somewhere else, i.e. not at home, while I get a new router and change the ISP from Yoigo to Movistar.
- They put the `FalconSensorMacOS.MaverickGyr.pkg` on both my work and my personal laptop. The files are [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MPTzekQ0o7pLizShUsWR_b-3qq73Aa-W/view?usp=sharing).
- A few hours later, a stalker account tweets about 11.11 and references relationships.

![Tweet about 11:11](../../content/images/hacked-work-laptop/stalker-account-mentions-it.png)

- The following day, I tweet about it.

![Tweet about 11:11](../../content/images/hacked-work-laptop/router-hack-tweet.png)

- From this point, I block all my cameras on laptops and phones with post it notes, or paper and sticky tape. 

### Nowhere

- I get a desk at Nowhere co-working space in Dénia: https://www.knowheredenia.com/.

### I tweet about it

- Sharing information always makes me feel safer.
- The following tweets are translated a lot.
    - https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1766039222308188548
    - https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1766127546100228463

## Sunday 10th March

### Text my family at the Chinese

- Online, the stalkers are continuing to suggest I call my family.
- With my iPhone, I send a text to my mother's mobile number at the Chinese while I'm having dinner one Sunday evening.
- There is a celebratory noise from my phone, and from another phone nearby.
- I'm not able to get through to my mother.
- I believe they are trying to target my family now, with phone numbers, etc, for the purposed of fraud.
- Writing about this now, I realize that it was all too much to comprehend and so, like I always did with abuse, I noticed it, and filed it away until such time as I could deal with it.

## Monday 11th March

### Chamber music class

- I am extraordinarily stressed and explain to Katia that I am fearful for my life and I'm worried I'm going to be robbed.
- An account pops up over the next few days which appears to be [referencing Katia moaning about this publicly](../../content/images/fake-accounts/list/52.png).

### Cracked rib

- I crack a rib during yoga class.
- I wonder if whatever I'm ingesting that is making me extremely stressed and anxious causes bone thinning, because it happened again a few months later.
- I have to pause yoga for a month or so while it gets better.
- It's good timing.
- Some drugs make your bones thinner and make it more likely to experience this sort of thing.

## Tuesday 12th March

### Pablo is given a role again

- I'm walking into Denia to attend harmony classes with Alfonso.
- As I approach the road of the conservatory, Pablo from my chamber music class comes out of a doorway. He looks frustrated and upset. I realize he has been asked to join in the choreography of terror against me.
- I feel bad for him and run past him.

### Domingo adjusts the child's rucksack

- Teachers glare at me angrily as I enter the conservatory. 
- It's a warning.
- Domingo has his hands on a small girl of about 6 years old's shoulders, apparently adjusting her rucksack.
- They're on the steps going up to the front door as I pass them.
- He glances at me meaningfully in the way he does.
- It looks like he is adjusting her rucksack but I wonder now if this is a demonstration for my benefit of the power he has over very young children and how no-one can do a thing about it.
- Is this how they drug people; create a diversion and add powder into the neck area or ear maybe?

### Ana dresses as if she's pregnant

- The Ana girlfriend lie continues and, with the help of others, she choreographs ridiculous situations - i.e. tracks my movements using shared WhatsApp groups with the other teachers - in order that I see her going to the toilet dressed as if she is pregnant.
- It's around this time I am feeling like I want to have a child, although this has been on and off for months. I believe this is suggestions from Twitter or online hacking, subliminal messages, etc.
- On one of the last times I attended classes at the conservatory, probably Wednesday 13th March, Ana is playing trumpet music on her laptop and I hear it from her classroom as I walk by.

### A serious attack on my wellbeing from piano teachers at Dénia conservatory

- On Tuesday 12th March, there is a end of term piano concert at the Casa de Cultura in Dénia.
- I leave from the conservatory and walk over to the venue.
- It's a huge set up, all meant to terrify me, probably give me a nervous breakdown, and maybe kill myself too.
- Each piece the kids play at the concert is related to things I have said on Twitter, or in letters to the Generalitat asking for help that were ignored.
- I'm surprised and somewhat alarmed to see the little Romanian boy who had been so energetic and full of life whenever I saw him previously looking so unwell and anxious. It makes me wonder.

!!! danger
    - I'm really worried about this boy now, he was a beautiful boy.
    - Could they be so sick and twisted, they were demonstrating proudly what they do to children?
    - Just like [the two drugged girls](../2022/june.md#maria-and-domingo) in June 2022.
    - Or the [girls at the audition](../2022/june.md#conservatory-audition).
    - Or [Elvira in her vest](../2023/may.md#elvira).
    - Or the [tiny child Domingo was apparently helping](#domingo-adjusts-the-childs-rucksack). 
    - Horrifying.
    
- There are pieces with related names, including something like "Four Aunts" by a modern composer called Mercedes Zavala (this is a horribly aggressive piece that Antonio Signes Argudo plays very well), [poison and aunts](../early-years/2014.md#poisoned-aunts), and other related things.

![Poisoned aunt](../../content/tweets/poisoned-aunt.png)

- Before we begin, people are coming in to listen. Many of them look at me and smile.
- I recognize a couple as [two people I saw on the beach](../2023/september.md#dog-tags-and-his-missus) following me and part of the group of people making sexual noises the September previous.
- At 7.30, the concert begins.
- At that moment, the lights go down, and the door to the hall opens, and in walks a woman who has dressed to look exactly like Lorraine Blackbourn, my friend who committed suicide.

![The most evil people in Denia by far](../../content/images/lorraine-at-the-piano-concert.png)

- She has done a really good job of it too. 
- I gasp.
- At precisely that moment, my security camera at home goes off and sounds an alarm on my phone. I don't have time to look.
- The woman dressed as Lorraine (who I now believe to be Carmen Cano, Domingo's sister) and a man sit directly behind me, in seats that have been saved for them.
- When I go up to play, I'm certain I'm not leaving my handbag at my chair (as I usually would) because these criminals are sitting right behind me. Instead, I take my bag onto the stage and leave it on the floor by the piano.
- I do a surprisingly good job with the Mozart Sonata I've been memorizing, apart from the last bit which I muck up. The pounding heart, screaming nervous system, and overwhelming stress is somehow helpful in getting focused on the job at hand.
- Patricia, Christine BJ, and another English woman have come to listen. They probably know what's going on, it's not clear. They're pretending not to know. Certainly there is a frosty feeling, and when we walk out and I insist I'm going to continue playing the piano, and play some Spanish flamenco at the next concert, Patricia visibly grimaces.
- When I get home that night, I check my camera security camera. 

![Screenshot of the security cam alarm pic](../../content/documents/evidence/12-march-alarm-notification.jpeg)

- There's an orb in the video it captured. 
- I post a Twitter poll about it: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1767647188698509820
- a stalker account retweets my poll and makes a weird comment.

![Security cam threats](../../content/tweets/piano-concert-threat.png)
![Security cam threats](../../content/tweets/piano-concert-threat-info.png)

- After the concert, I'm blocked from downloading the videos of the concert on the Generalitat's systems.

### My crypto account

- I lose access to my Coinbase crypto account that night.
- I don't know if they have stolen 70K from me or not.
- My account is completely locked.
- I'm really concerned about this.
- I tweet about it: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1768093834188087798.
