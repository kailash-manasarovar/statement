# March 1st-12th 2024

## Monday 4th March chamber music class

- Esteve the chamber music teacher brings us a new song to perform.
- It is [Rossini's cat duet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duetto_buffo_di_due_gatti) for two sopranos and piano.
- The irony is not lost on me.

- Katia didn't turn up for class that Monday so the other lady and I are practicing together.
- I find the whole thing rather amusing and laugh. I guess I'm supposed to be offended, stressed, terrorized, etc., but it is just too ridiculous for words.
- Esteve is surprised at my reaction and asks, "do you find it funny?"
- What did he expect?
- I wonder at that moment if Esteve is aware that I am suffering from intense criminal gang stalking and violent harassment online and in the town.
- I can't believe it, he's such a lovely fellow. In retrospect I guess I was wrong about everyone but the question remains, to what degree was I wrong about him.
- Curiously, as I am accompanying the other student meowing loudly, a black and white cat comes up to the window, and sits, and listens.
- I point the cat out to everyone. 
- They both look and are slightly amazed.
- You can ask them about that :)

### A fake account with Esteve's face as profile

- In April, I'm followed by an account `ChoralSymphony` with a profile picture of Esteve on it.

[![Esteve](../../../content/tweets/march-2024/ludwig-van-b.png)](https://x.com/ChoralSymphony)

- This account is either run by [Hazel Smith herself](../../early-years/2007.md#hazel-smith), or someone pretending to be her, perhaps someone from the Cano family?
- Whoever it was, they knew a lot of extremely private matters about her that only I knew, and had *never told anyone*.
- Even in October 2023, [when I tweeted the story on X of how I had been drugged - possibly with the intention of murder in Denia in 2007](../../2023/october.md#tweeting-about-being-spiked-in-2007), and very *very* interestingly just after waking up in the wee hours and feeling compelled to do so, even then I never mentioned her name. 
- But, if she was part of the constant surveillance, she would have known immediately. 
- Just a few days before Esteve's class, I had reported another fake account with a photo of Hazel's face mixed with mine by an AI process.

[![Reporting Hazel profile pic](../../../content/tweets/march-2024/reporting-hazel-profile-pic.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1763160058647429141)

- Another fake account pops in right after.

![Another Hazel fake account](../../../content/tweets/march-2024/hazel-ref.png)

## Online communication with gang-stalkers

### Porn fatwa

- Sometimes, I tweet messages which show how I'm always trying to figure out what is going on.
- I'm getting close to [the truth](../../early-years/2003.md#porn-fatwa) here.

![Porn fatwa](../../../content/tweets/march-2024/porn-fatwa-ideas.png)

### I tell them why I won't leave

- I've thought about it carefully, and I realized leaving my studies at the conservatory - and away from people who might notice me go missing, or die, or whatever - would put me in enormous danger.
- I tweet polls and explain my thinking on this in detail.

![Poll and thoughts on it](../../../content/tweets/march-2024/why-i-wont-leave/poll-about-male-violence.png)

![Poll and thoughts on it](../../../content/tweets/march-2024/why-i-wont-leave/responding-to-stalkers.png)

- The following two tweets are in conversation to someone close to the matter suggesting I should leave.

![Poll and thoughts on it](../../../content/tweets/march-2024/why-i-wont-leave/stalker-account-trying-to-get-me-to-leave-1-all-posts-deleted.png)

![Poll and thoughts on it](../../../content/tweets/march-2024/why-i-wont-leave/stalker-account-trying-to-get-me-to-leave-2-all-posts-deleted.png)

- It's interesting that given indeed they do get me to leave my studies in a matter of weeks from now, I'm still working for Polygon, so they can't dispatch with me while I'm turning up for meetings every day online.
- Is this why they manipulated the job at Polygon for me? So I would have a lot more money to rob in a violent honey-trap relationship.
- I would also be extremely easy to [fire, isolate, and destroy forever](../../2024/october.md#polygon-fires-the-whole-writing-team) while being live-streamed to the world?
- Did the whole Polygon staff, as well as [British node operators given bus tickets sitting beside me](../../2023/september.md#polygon-node-operators-on-the-bus-home), know what was happening to me?
- How many of my colleagues were paying for live-stream subscriptions of me sedated in my Dénia apartment?

![Big tech involvement](../../../content/tweets/march-2024/why-i-wont-leave/big-tech-up-to-their-necks-in-it.png)

### Reporting being drugged

- Is this tweet evidence of being drugged again?

![Drugged again](../../../content/tweets/march-2024/reporting-a-dose-maybe.png)

### Reporting cyber-stalking intensity growth

![Cyber-stalking intensifying](../../../content/tweets/march-2024/reporting-on-stalker-intensity-growing.png)

### Winding them up

- I admit, I really enjoyed winding them up.

![Wind ups](../../../content/tweets/march-2024/wind-ups-and-warnings-and-whiskers-on-kittens-1.png)

![Wind ups](../../../content/tweets/march-2024/wind-ups-and-warnings-and-whiskers-on-kittens-2.png)

- Nevertheless, I constantly try to communicate normally with them too.

![Always trying to communicate](../../../content/tweets/march-2024/always-trying-to-communicate.png)

### The forgivenet

- I never stop thinking about how much these people could help my forgiveness app get going.
- They would be an ideal first batch of genuine users, imho.

![Crypto app mentions](../../../content/tweets/march-2024/crypto-app-ideas.png)

## Tuesday 5th March piano lesson

### An inspector calls

- I arrive at my piano lesson.
- Paqui Fornet, my piano teacher, is busy at her desk.
- I wait, and a moment later there is a knock at the door.
- The director of the conservatory, Jaume Signes, is at the door with a woman I've never seen before.
- Jaume introduces the woman briefly to Paqui and leaves.
- I'm feeling excessive stress at this moment. 
- My arms feel very heavy and it's difficult to move them.
- The woman is a large, dark, curly-haired woman of about 50 years old and I would recognize her again.

![An inspector calls from the GV](../../../content/images/inspector.png)

- Paqui explains the woman is an *inspector* from the Generalitat and she is here to help me.
- Paqui repeats the phrase that the woman is *here to help me* a number of times.
- I feel like it's probably an ambush and put my phone on record, except my fingers aren't working properly and I'm not sure if I have done it correctly.
- The women are not concerned I might be recording them.
- Paqui reiterates that the woman is *here to help me* with everything that's going on.
- I understand this to mean that she is here to help me because I previously told Paqui I was [being terrorized by Domingo Cano and his associates](../january.md#i-tell-paqui-im-being-terrorized-by-teachers-and-staff-at-the-conservatory) and was concerned about my safety.
- The first thing the woman says is they are going to get the police involved.
- I am delighted and express gratitude because something is finally happening after nearly two years of abuse instigated by a piano teacher.
- Paqui looks nervous.
- I ask the inspector why the Generalitat has not replied to any of my emails or letters.
- She tells me they did reply in December 2023 but the letter was returned because they did not have my street address. This is ridiculous, obviously.
- I mention that I sent all my complaints by email, from my email address which they have, and that my street address is in the systems, and that they could have asked me, or informed me, or replied to me at any time.
- She ignores me and shows me the enclosing envelope and the return notice from the post office.

[![Receipt of postage](../../../content/images/inspector-letters-1.png)](../../../content/documents/gv/8.%20Receipt%20date%20received%205%20March%20at%20piano%20lesson.JPG)

- [The document receipt in full](../../../content/documents/gv/8.%20Receipt%20of%20something%20from%20the%20Generalitat%201%205%20March%202023.jpeg).

[![A part of the document they apparently sent](../../../content/images/inspector-letters-2.png)](../../../content/documents/gv/8.%20Receipt%20of%20something%20from%20the%20Generalitat%202%205%20March%202023.jpeg)

- I ask her for the content of the letter they sent, which I do not see in the documents she has.
- She says, *oh that doesn't matter now, it's too late for that now*.
- The woman's tone and demeanor is not at all friendly towards me. 
- She wants to know about my social media activity, particularly on X.
- She suggests I have been saying things I shouldn't have been saying.
- She says *everything is too public now and the police will need to be called*.
- I say something like *thank God, I have been stalked for nearly 2 years, I wrote to the GV numerous times about this horrible situation, so I would very much welcome the police getting involved*.
- The woman is a bit taken aback; Paqui looks even more nervous.
- The woman then goes on to reiterate that I have been saying things online and the police must be called.
- I ask her what *exactly* she has a problem with?
- She doesn't reply and instead starts asking me questions about what I'm saying on Twitter.
- I find it very threatening. 
- I tell her I don't like the way she is talking to me, and say that I'm not speaking to her further without a lawyer present.
- The woman leaves. 
- I never hear from her or anyone else from the Generalitat again until I receive [a letter in April ignoring all my complaints and saying there is nothing untoward going on at the conservatory](../april.md#response-from-generalitat).
- They send this letter after I have left my studies due to becoming genuinely afraid for my life.
- Is that what they were hoping would happen over [Christmas when the gang-stalking broke all scholarly boundaries](../../2023/december.md#christmas), and yet I still returned?
- I can only assume that everyone, top to bottom, knew *exactly* what was happening to me, in fact welcomed it as long as it got me to leave my studies as soon as possible.
- Furthermore, the constant noise I was making about what was going on online must have been making everyone extremely uncomfortable.
- I guess I had to be silenced and gotten rid of.
- Once I was gone, I expect they thought they would be able to get back to [normal operations](#domingo-adjusts-the-childs-rucksack).
- My suspicion is that normal operations never once ceased; not then and not today, with the blessing and support of the Spanish government and police.

## Wednesday 6th March

### Stolen iPad

- I can't find my iPad and I believe it is stolen.
- I ask Gloria at the conservatory if anyone has handed in an iPad.
- She becomes extremely concerned about it and we go looking around the building.
- She is really upset about the thought an iPad might have been stolen. I find it astonishing.
- Her concern for my iPad far extends any concern she might have had for me, a student, being terrorized by Domingo, a teacher, and his associates, which includes her of course.
- When we are upstairs, I speak to her about what's going on privately. I tell her I can't believe how it just goes on and on.
- She looks scared. She is shaking and her voice is trembling.
- I tell her "you know it's not just me they're looking at online". An alarmed flash crosses her face.
- She suggests I go and talk to Enric Gil who is works at the town hall in the capacity of welcoming foreign people who have just moved to the area.

### Enric Gil

- I go to see Enric. I know him already from  when I lived in Dénia previously in 2006-9, and we had friends in common.
- I tell him everything. 
- As I start to mention the threats from Domingo he shuts me down.
- He says I should see the Dénia local police who have a division for gender violence.
- We go outside.
- I'm speaking to him and he's laughing at me while I do. I wonder if someone is behind me making faces or playing the fool. It's unsettling.
- He goes to talk to a local police officer and comes back.
- He says I cannot raise anything with them as I don't have a partner and they only deal with male violence when it occurs within a partnership.

### Trying to find help

- I don't know what to do, where to turn, who to ask for help.
- The Policia Nacional are disinterested, the local police don't want to know, the Generalitat is suggesting they are going to have *me* arrested for being a victim of cyber stalking and gang stalking and talking about it on Twitter. It's overwhelmingly stressful.
- I have searched for a human rights lawyer and send some random emails to try and get help.
- I was able to finally communicate with the ECHR when I was in Brussels in July: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1811523447123558841.

!!! warning
    - The stress levels are really intensifying during this period.

### A donation to a twitter account

- I make a £100 donation to a Twitter account online: https://x.com/latsot.
- This is a well known account in the UK feminist communities and is even supported by https://niaendingviolence.org.uk/.
- At the very moment I make the donation, he posts this: https://x.com/latsot/status/1765118778684342347.
- A fake account comments on being jealous.
- I'm so concerned about this, I look up Rob Smith's websites, and I see he does an awful lot of fundraising but there are no pictures of him doing anything at all.
- I contact nia about it I'm so concerned but they're convinced he's legit.
- I wonder if Rob Smith is connected to Sandra and Hazel Smith.

### Carmen Cano

- Right after this, a fake account whizzes by on likes with the name Carmen Cano.
- I can only assume it is a message from someone to make me think Carmen Cano is behind the scam.
- Carmen Cano being Domingo the piano teacher's sister.

![Carmen Cano](../../../content/images/fake-accounts/carmen-cano.png)

### Scarfs from the lady who knows who I am

- I buy some scarves from a shop in the Calle La Mar, could be Vintage Ibiza.
- It's run by a polish woman who is very nice.
- We chat and I tell her I'm studying piano at the conservatory.
- She becomes very embarrassed and is unable to speak to me. She knows who I am.
- This shop had a picture in the window of Frida Khalo for months.
- Often, in the Google search results for `@jctot19` there were pictures of Frida Khalo and references to the trumpet teacher having another girlfriend.
- Ridiculous, I know.
- Amazing that the people of Dénia would put so much effort into all this, and it must have cost a lot of time, effort, and money to keep it going. 
- I now wonder if they were perhaps making more money than they were spending from either:
    - Mass voyeurism on social media of "hunted" or targeted women in Spain.
    - Mass voyeurism of women being filmed on hidden cameras in their homes, possibly amateur porn networks, something I often saw in my Google results.
    - Mass voyeurism of people who enjoy watching others suffer.

## Thursday 7th March

### Hackers reference payments I have made

- I start to see references to payments I have made online, including exact figures, and sometimes even mentions of the payee.
- One was in reference to a charity gift I gave to a Twitter account around that time, after which I receive a follow from a fake account that was "jealous".
- Shortly after this, another remarkable set of tweet references were related to a monetary gift I had sent to my monk friend of 333 euros at Christmas.
- As you may remember, they refer to the monk as "panda".

![Panda 333](../../../content/tweets/panda-333-1.png)
![Panda 333](../../../content/tweets/panda-333-3.png)
![Panda 333](../../../content/tweets/panda-333-4.png)
![Panda 333](../../../content/tweets/panda-333-5.png)

- I'm pretty sure the `@crispolata` account is Hazel or Sandra Smith, or one of their associates.

#### Fake accounts reference payments I have made online

- I sent a financial a gift to my friend for Christmas.
- My friend is a Tibetan monk and [he visited me in September 2023](../../2023/september.md#the-tibetan-monk-visits) when I was being severely terrorized online and in-person in the town.
- Fake accounts post the payment amount to me, while I'm in the middle of an X thread with a [stalker account about "pandas"](../march/1-12.md#thursday-7th-march).

### Change root password

- I change the root password on my laptop.
- The router is off.
- The following morning, Friday 8th March, half of my new root password appears on a fake account's profile message.

## Friday 8th March

### Report hacking to work

- I opened a Twitter account for work on my work laptop, I can't remember when.
- Immediately, I was followed by accounts with names related to the gang stalking.
- I filed it away, it was too much to deal with at that moment, although I did raise a ticket with IT at one point when I saw something weird.
- With everything going on, I realize it's time to tell the security department at my work I think I've been hacked.
- Gordon Bishop of Polygon Labs investigates. 
- He asks me to access 1.1.1.1 on my browser. What he's expecting to happen, doesn't happen. 
- He's expecting to see the WARP webpage but, instead, we get the login page for the network router.

![Router login](../../../content/images/hacked-work-laptop/router-login.png)

- He also sees some weird stuff with Mac certificates.

![Mac certificates](../../../content/images/hacked-work-laptop/weird-issues-with-certificates.png)

- He asks me to check on FireFox too.

![Firefox security alert](../../../content/images/hacked-work-laptop/hacking-alert.png)

!!! tip
    - The screenshots above are from my work laptop.

- He says this is enough evidence of hacking through the router for them to lock me down and reformat my laptop.
- I have to work somewhere else, i.e. not at home, while I get a new router and change the ISP from Yoigo to Movistar.
- They put the `FalconSensorMacOS.MaverickGyr.pkg` on both my work and my personal laptop. The files are [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MPTzekQ0o7pLizShUsWR_b-3qq73Aa-W/view?usp=sharing).
- A few hours later, a stalker account tweets about 11.11 and references relationships.

![Tweet about 11:11](../../../content/images/hacked-work-laptop/stalker-account-mentions-it.png)

- The following day, I tweet about it.

![Tweet about 11:11](../../../content/images/hacked-work-laptop/router-hack-tweet.png)

- From this point, I block all my cameras on laptops and phones with post it notes, or paper and sticky tape. 

### Nowhere

- I get a desk at Nowhere co-working space in Dénia: https://www.knowheredenia.com/.

### I tweet about it

- Sharing information always makes me feel safer.
- The following tweets are translated a lot.
    - https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1766039222308188548
    - https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1766127546100228463

## Sunday 10th March

### Text my family at the Chinese

- Online, the stalkers are continuing to suggest I call my family.
- With my iPhone, I send a text to my mother's mobile number at the Chinese while I'm having dinner one Sunday evening.
- There is a celebratory noise from my phone, and from another phone nearby.
- I'm not able to get through to my mother.
- I believe they are trying to target my family now, with phone numbers, etc, for the purposed of fraud.
- Writing about this now, I realize that it was all too much to comprehend and so, like I always did with abuse, I noticed it, and filed it away until such time as I could deal with it.

## Monday 11th March

### Chamber music class

- I am extraordinarily stressed and explain to Katia that I am fearful for my life and I'm worried I'm going to be robbed.
- An account pops up over the next few days which appears to be [referencing Katia moaning about this publicly](../../../content/images/fake-accounts/list/52.png).

### Cracked rib

- I crack a rib during yoga class.
- I wonder if whatever I'm ingesting that is making me extremely stressed and anxious causes bone thinning, because it happened again a few months later.
- I have to pause yoga for a month or so while it gets better.
- It's good timing.
- Some drugs make your bones thinner and make it more likely to experience this sort of thing.

## Tuesday 12th March

### Pablo is given a role again

- I'm walking into Denia to attend harmony classes with Alfonso.
- As I approach the road of the conservatory, Pablo from my chamber music class comes out of a doorway. He looks frustrated and upset. I realize he has been asked to join in the choreography of terror against me.
- I feel bad for him and run past him.

### Domingo adjusts the child's rucksack

- Teachers glare at me angrily as I enter the conservatory. 
- It's a warning.
- Domingo has his hands on a small girl of about 6 years old's shoulders, apparently adjusting her rucksack.
- They're on the steps going up to the front door as I pass them.
- He glances at me meaningfully in the way he does.
- It looks like he is adjusting her rucksack but I wonder now if this is a demonstration for my benefit of the power he has over very young children and how no-one can do a thing about it.
- Is this how they drug people; create a diversion and add powder into the neck area or ear maybe?

### Ana dresses as if she's pregnant

- The Ana girlfriend lie continues and, with the help of others, she choreographs ridiculous situations - i.e. tracks my movements using shared WhatsApp groups with the other teachers - in order that I see her going to the toilet dressed as if she is pregnant.
- It's around this time I am feeling like I want to have a child, although this has been on and off for months. I believe this is suggestions from Twitter or online hacking, subliminal messages, etc.
- On one of the last times I attended classes at the conservatory, probably Wednesday 13th March, Ana is playing trumpet music on her laptop and I hear it from her classroom as I walk by.

### A serious attack on my wellbeing from piano teachers at Dénia conservatory

- On Tuesday 12th March, there is a end of term piano concert at the Casa de Cultura in Dénia.
- I leave from the conservatory and walk over to the venue.
- It's a huge set up, all meant to terrify me, probably give me a nervous breakdown, and maybe kill myself too.
- Each piece the kids play at the concert is related to things I have said on Twitter, or in letters to the Generalitat asking for help that were ignored.
- I'm surprised and somewhat alarmed to see the little Romanian boy who had been so energetic and full of life whenever I saw him previously looking so unwell and anxious. It makes me wonder.

!!! danger
    - I'm really worried about this boy now, he was a beautiful boy.
    - Could they be so sick and twisted, they were demonstrating proudly what they do to children?
    - Just like [the two drugged girls](../../2022/june.md#maria-and-domingo) in June 2022.
    - Or the [girls at the audition](../../2022/june.md#conservatory-audition).
    - Or [Elvira in her vest](../../2023/may.md#elvira).
    - Or the [tiny child Domingo was apparently helping](#domingo-adjusts-the-childs-rucksack). 
    - Horrifying.
    
- There are pieces with related names, including something like "Four Aunts" by a modern composer called Mercedes Zavala (this is a horribly aggressive piece that Antonio Signes Argudo plays very well), [poison and aunts](../../early-years/2014.md#poisoned-aunts), and other related things.

![Poisoned aunt](../../../content/tweets/poisoned-aunt.png)

- Before we begin, people are coming in to listen. Many of them look at me and smile.
- I recognize a couple as [two people I saw on the beach](../../2023/september.md#dog-tags-and-his-missus) following me and part of the group of people making sexual noises the September previous.
- At 7.30, the concert begins.
- At that moment, the lights go down, and the door to the hall opens, and in walks a woman who has dressed to look exactly like Lorraine Blackbourn, my friend who committed suicide.

![The most evil people in Denia by far](../../../content/images/lorraine-at-the-piano-concert.png)

- She has done a really good job of it too. 
- I gasp.
- At precisely that moment, my security camera at home goes off and sounds an alarm on my phone. I don't have time to look.
- The woman dressed as Lorraine (who I now believe to be Carmen Cano, Domingo's sister) and a man sit directly behind me, in seats that have been saved for them.
- When I go up to play, I'm certain I'm not leaving my handbag at my chair (as I usually would) because these criminals are sitting right behind me. Instead, I take my bag onto the stage and leave it on the floor by the piano.
- I do a surprisingly good job with the Mozart Sonata I've been memorizing, apart from the last bit which I muck up. The pounding heart, screaming nervous system, and overwhelming stress is somehow helpful in getting focused on the job at hand.
- Patricia, Christine BJ, and another English woman have come to listen. They probably know what's going on, it's not clear. They're pretending not to know. Certainly there is a frosty feeling, and when we walk out and I insist I'm going to continue playing the piano, and play some Spanish flamenco at the next concert, Patricia visibly grimaces.
- When I get home that night, I check my camera security camera. 

![Screenshot of the security cam alarm pic](../../../content/documents/evidence/12-march-alarm-notification.jpeg)

- There's an orb in the video it captured. 
- I post a Twitter poll about it: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1767647188698509820
- a stalker account retweets my poll and makes a weird comment.

![Security cam threats](../../../content/tweets/piano-concert-threat.png)
![Security cam threats](../../../content/tweets/piano-concert-threat-info.png)

- After the concert, I'm blocked from downloading the videos of the concert on the Generalitat's systems.
