- https://x.com/january_myth/status/1772034747775992249 -> the Taru Ann account, which may be sometimes run by Patricia retweets a post from 29th August 2023, around the time the hackers are revealing themselves. I don't remember seeing it at that time but I may have and it just didn't register as connected.

- At the same time, she retweets a pic from 12th June 2023, which I have been unable to locate so [asked the account owner about it directly](../../../content/tweets/long-long-way-to-go.png) and she has posted the pic: https://x.com/january_myth/status/1860955287672213591/photo/1 but not the poem that went with it. I remember seeing that one but, again, I made no connection to this account.
- I ask her about the poem.

- It's curious that she deleted the tweet from 12th June 2023.
- She just deleted a tweet replied to me today (Friday 29th November) in a way to **call out** the fact that she deletes tweets from time to time, except she never did it before today (Friday 29th November).
- I begin to suspect that whoever is managing the Taru Ann account could be well known to me.
- On September 22nd, after weird communication from Patricia all summer, I wonder if Taru Ann is Patricia from time to time by delegation: https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1837596563557831058. The account likes my question in response. It could be anyone I guess but certainly someone involved somehow.

- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1770385824359608528 -> this was another tactic the stalkers used, posting my own tweets back at me, or liking them so that I would see the messages in order to terrorize me further.

- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1773059705549508827 -> Paqui on a fake account. She looks like she wants to kill herself.

## `@JackChardwood`

- It seems the tweets in here for this period are mostly related to romance and relationship, i.e. keeping the lie going.
