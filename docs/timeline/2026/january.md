## A "date" in Barcelona

- Word on the street is I had a "date" in Barcelona: meaning yet another sedated rape event.
- I'm wondering when that could have been.
- I was up and down to Barcelona so many times between 2005-2016 when I lived in Denia and Madrid.
- Let's list those visits here - as much as possible - and see which one (or more) is the most likely; although I'm going for the time I visited Barcelona in 2016 to do a yoga class with P Jois's daughter who had flown in from India and I stayed in a hotel outside the city in a small town with the most expensive parking meters in Spain, probably.
- There was a very suspicious time at the Amma retreat in Barcelona in 2015 maybe. If a sedated event had happened there, it would have been with others as I was sharing a room.
- Then there was the Cleargreen retreat where I was again sharing with others if something had happened, which is possible as we were staying in the homes of people who were living there at the same time.
- Was Jess from the [Avila meditation retreat centre cum porn studio in December 2023](../2023/december.md#vipasana-meditation) at the Cleargreen retreat also?
- Of course, there was the invitation from Grace to meet her and Nadim (and others I suppose) in Barcelona just after I started at Polygon too.
- I'll do a full and thorough list cos there's so much of it.
- In progress.

## Could Brian have known who Ugly was back in 2001?

- Pathologically inclined to think the best of everyone - not a bad thing - I start to wonder if the [weird occurrence with the ugly man](../early-years/2001.md) in Amsterdam in 2001 implies that Brian - my boyfriend at the time - knew who he was?
- In November 2024, Brian and I had a long forgiving chat about the past on Facebook which was really healing.
- A few days later, [I remembered Ugly in the back of the car at the Holiday Inn in Amsterdam](../2024/december.md#unable-to-access-my-laptop) after a stalker account posted a triggering picture on X.
- I continue the Facebook chat with Brian, and I ask him if he remembered the weird event with the ugly man, or even me telling him about it?
- He answers: *we were very high in those days*, or similar, and nothing else.
- Not a: *no, what was that all about, that's weird*, or *mm, maybe I remember you saying something about that*... no.
- "We were very high in those days."
- He has now blocked me - also interesting - so I cannot quote him.
- Brian did have a dreadful coke habit at that time, which is also, perhaps, significant.
- I just followed along really... anyway.
- If Brian does know Ugly, that puts our relationship into an ugly place.
- Was there a sedated session that night in our hotel room in Amsterdam?
- I have vague recollections of being in the bar, drunk with Brian, perhaps chatting with people there, and then nothing until waking up in the middle of the night in our room apparently after going to bed and sleep.
- If Ugly was playing a part in our lives without my knowledge, did he also interact with Niall Brian's brother, [Paul](../2025/january.md#paul), yes *the* Paul, and even a common friend Simon who came to visit with the boys one evening (me the lone female in the house)?
- I have a feeling I remember Brian and Niall talking about a man they called "Ugly"... 
- "Who's Ugly", I asked them..

## Continuing threats

### Strange messages about dying for friends

- Over the last week or so, I have seen, repeatedly, a quote from the bible in the Gospel of John about friends who are willing to die for their friends.
- I even looked it up to see if it really existed as the language was a bit strange and I hadn't heard this quote before.
- It is from John 15, verse 13.
- Seeing this every day feels like a threat of some sort, a message, but I'm not sure what it's about.
- I haven't been watching the news.
- When I see the news about the Spanish train derailment I start to worry about Inma.
- I tried to email her from my `katharinejchardwood@gmail` account and lost access to the account.
- I emailed her from the Jack Chardwood account.
- Praying to God she's safe and well.

### A sinister man in the newsagents

- I feel, again, like if I leave the house anything could happen to me.
- I pop up the road to get pizza and a loaf of bread.
- A sinister cockney man comes into the newsagents right behind me and says "nice weather for ducks".
- The shopkeeper is concerned about him and watches his every move.
- I wonder if he is suggesting I'm a sitting duck.
