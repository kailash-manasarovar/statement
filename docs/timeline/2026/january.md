## A date in Barcelona

- Word on the street is I had a date in Barcelona.
- I'm wondering when now.
- I was up and down to Barcelona many times between 2005-2016 when I lived in Denia.
- Let's list those visits here - as much as possible - and see which one is the most likely although I'm going for the time I visited Barcelona in 2016 probably to do a yoga class with P Jois's daughter who had flown in from India and I stayed in a hotel outside the city in a small town with the most expensive parking meters in Spain, probably.
