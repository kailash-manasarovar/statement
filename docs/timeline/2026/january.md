## A "date" in Barcelona

- Word on the street is I had a "date" in Barcelona: meaning yet another sedated rape event.
- I'm wondering when that could have been.
- I was up and down to Barcelona so many times between 2005-2016 when I lived in Denia and Madrid.
- Let's list those visits here - as much as possible - and see which one (or more) is the most likely; although I'm going for the time I visited Barcelona in 2016 to do a yoga class with P Jois's daughter who had flown in from India and I stayed in a hotel outside the city in a small town with the most expensive parking meters in Spain, probably.
- There was a very suspicious time at the Amma retreat in Barcelona in 2015 maybe. If a sedated event had happened there, it would have been with others as I was sharing a room.
- Then there was the Cleargreen retreat where I was again sharing with others if something had happened, which is possible as we were staying in the homes of people who were living there at the same time.
- Was Jess from the [Avila meditation retreat centre cum porn studio in December 2023](../2023/december.md#vipasana-meditation) at the Cleargreen retreat also?
- Of course, there was the invitation from Grace to meet her and Nadim (and others I suppose) in Barcelona just after I started at Polygon too.
- I'll do a full and thorough list cos there's so much of it.
- In progress.
