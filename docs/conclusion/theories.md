# Theories

## First thoughts

Of course, I have run through multiple scenarios in an attempt to understand what was happening to me. They went, more or less, sequentially like this:

1. Domingo's revenge for not being able to control me in 2014 and put me in a life situation in which he and his family would benefit financially, and revenge for me blowing his cover a little at that time.
2. The trumpet teacher just being a part of this revenge for some reason and my feelings being real for him.
3. The hacking being a ridiculous and immature part of the revenge efforts, something that foolish men and their wives participate in throughout Denia and they just lost their minds.
4. Etc.

I've always tried to find ways to explain it which put people in the best light.

But everything got worse and worse, and anytime I uncovered some truth, there was more evil lurking underneath it. Nothing made sense and the elaborate and extremely resource-heavy and staged attacks make no sense without some substantial financial gain to someone.

Nevertheless, a great many people have helped enrich criminals and there must be some logical reason why they would do that. And there is one. It's an utterly insane reason, but completely logical.

### Misogyny of the worst kind

- I believe that the people of Denia and the surrounding areas were told that I had been a victim of pedophile rape gangs in London in 1989.
- I believe they were even shown the porn that the rape gang made at that time, where I was sedated and gang raped repeatedly, porn that undoubtedly very much "enriched" certain people's lives.
- I believe that the people that targeted me commonly blame rape victims, and domestic violence victims, for the acts of rapists and abusers, and moreover, and more astonishingly, they also blame child victims of pedophiles for the acts of pedophiles.
- I believe these rapists and pedophile protectors in Denia have the utmost respect for the gang leaders and instigators of the horror I endured for 3 years, and what, undoubtedly, many thousands of other women have endured in the region for decades and going back centuries traditionally.
- In the same way that trans activists are happy to sterilize and mutilate their children, and attack anyone questioning such barbaric practices, the people of Denia and the surrounding areas appear to have been delighted to have the opportunity to viciously target a lone woman, someone they thought vulnerable, because they insanely believed she deserved it.
- I also believe their behavior triggered an innate and unchecked blood-thirstiness that is now totally out of control.

## A summary of what happened with a start date of 2013

1. Domingo singled me out as a good candidate for honey-trapping on the words of someone he knew, possibly Zoe  Jones but more likely Hazel Smith in 2013/14.
2. Domingo used Porsche to lure me into the conservatory as a student.
3. Domingo arranged me to rent the flat I was in from September 2014 which may have had surveillance in the form of hidden cameras.
4. I was hacked during that time and everything I did online was examined.
5. When I fell out with Domingo, some attempts were made to keep me in Denia: the job offer where I would be looking at genitals; Maria Hontanilla saying she would organize a job for me at Denia hospital.
6. Before I left Denia in 2016, I wrote a statement to the Metropolitan police about the North London rape gangs which they will have seen.
7. Between leaving Denia in 2016 and returning in 2022, I may have been surveilled continuously via the gitano hacking networks and they would have seen how much I was earning in those years, which was considerable.
8. I was lured back to the conservatory with the help of Patricia and friends while walking.
9. Once back, the gang stalking began, with the intention of:
    1. Me falling in love with the trumpet teacher.
    2. My crucifixion (termed funeral by the conservatory porn gangs) on 12th June 2023 where I would be hurt, shamed, and humiliated.
    3. The trumpet teacher reappearing shortly after to "save me"; him meeting me at Alicante airport.
    4. A relationship between us beginning possibly leading to marriage.
    5. I would likely go blind from methanol poisoning and he would rob me easily.
    6. I would eventually be murdered in some appalling manner that no-one could ever prove and he would take all my money via inheritance.
10. Poisoning began in 2022 and my elevated eye pressure - something I never had previously - was noted in Denia during that time and is now a diagnosis of primary angle closure suspect. I could lose my sight at any moment, and I believe this was a long term goal and had started very early on.

!!! info
    - At the time of writing my sight is very poor -> Bangkok November 2024.
    - My eyes and sight has never felt like this.
    - My eyes are red and bloodshot, and difficult to open in the morning.
    - There's a constant discomfort, someone else might call it pain (I have a high pain threshold).
    - I'm sensitive to light and feel heaviness around my eyes all the time.
    - I'm very worried about it. 
    - I have never felt like this before and it started that week I was home from Fatima on 27th October 2024 until 3rd November 2024 when I left for London.
    - I have samples for testing.

## Alternative theory with an earlier start date, probably 2006

- I believe now that the trumpet teacher and Domingo the piano teacher are a pornographer/honey trapper pair working with their families to film and rob women and girls of their money and peaceful enjoyment of their lives.
- They knew of my child sexual abuse history from Hazel Smith in 2007 and from reading my police statement in 2016 while hacking my home network.
- They planned to lure me back with the intention of a reenactment of the crimes committed against me in 1989. However, participants in the gang rape would be local "respectable" men; doctors, my neigbours, the dentist, etc.
- I believe my apartment was set up to livestream my activities and an aphrodisiac of some sort was used on me which was overwhelming.
- It's possible they sedated me and entered the flat without my knowledge and sexual attacked me while filming.
- I have no recollection of that happening however; neither did I note any physical changes that may have pointed to that.
- The trumpet teacher meeting me at the airport would have signified the beginning of a relationship but it also could have included a reenactment of gang rape and/or online streaming of sexual activity at my apartment.
- I believe men were already paying for access to this, may have paid in advance also, and may be disappointed that nothing more than masturbation happened.
- I believe men had paid for, and received copies/viewings of, the original child rape porn from 1989 that Domingo the piano teacher and the trumpet teacher managed to get hold of.
- Winston May popping up while I was campaigning for the general election with a lot of police informant volunteers seems to point to a very close connection between the original London rape gang and the Denia criminal gangs.
- It is highly likely the trumpet teacher's real name is Paco Sendra; the name of the married man [Hazel Smith told me she was having sex with in 2007](../timeline/early-years/2007.md#hazel-smith). The implications behind this are extraordinary.
