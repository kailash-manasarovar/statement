## Garbure

- I love the smell of garbure in the morning.
- Garbure is a local dish of the Pyrenees and you can smell it cooking in Lourdes in the morning. It's a very wonderful smell.

## Batman and little girl

- I heard this said a lot around the conservatory, and it also came up on meme's on Twitter.
