- I believe these are symbols used by manipulators online to generate reliable triggers in a target.
- Some of these are fairly sinister.
- And some of these memes are mine, because I figured out what they were up to and I played their game back at them by instead shining light not darkness. 

## Garbure

- My meme. My favorite.

[![I love the smell of garbure in the morning](../content/images/garbure-in-the-morning.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1711312917998538845)

- I gave at least as good as I got online, certainly in the early days.
- Once I realized I was being full-on cyber-stalked ([12th June 2023](../timeline/2023/june.md#monday-12th-june-2023)) and started recognizing the patterns, I made every attempt to fight back. 
- Lately, I'm probably ahead.
- *I love the smell of garbure in the morning*, is my favorite proprietary meme.
- Garbure is a local dish from the Pyrenees and you can smell it being prepared in the hotel kitchens in Lourdes every morning.

- I certainly felt that Mary was on my side helping me deal with these people; and that this was mine, Hers, and Saint Bernadette's battle-cry.
- Here's a poll about garbure from December 2023.

- Here's a tweet about how this meme should be the title of my biography.

[![Biography title](../content/tweets/memes/garbure-again.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1733764096124706962)

- I wonder how it must have been for them to have gone from total certainty about my lack of humanity and the inevitability of my doom at their hands, to an inkling something wasn't going the way it usually did, to their stressed states nowadays as the pit of their own making swallows them up.
- I also wonder what it must have been like for the righteous silenced-and-fearful to watch these changes occur, still in marvelous progress.
- When Mary's with you, and they knew She was with me, nothing can hurt you.
- They know this too.
- The only explanation for their outrageous behavior is a mass criminal and psychopathic hysteria possibly born of watching too many mafia films.
- Unless, of course, this is a common occurrence in Spain, and everyone knows who the targets are, everyone is told about them, and I'm the only person who has put up a worthy fight.
- This is the scary option because it means they expect it, welcome it even, and it also means countless lives have been destroyed in similar circumstances in the most appalling ways.
- It also explains why no-one helped me and instead made sure I knew they thought I was dirt and deserved whatever was happening to me; a mass guilt projection.
- If I had been aware that this is normal practice in Spain and foreign women and children including babies are major targets, I would have avoided moving to Spain as much as I would have avoided moving to Afghanistan, and for the same reason.

## Batman and little girl

- I heard this said a lot around the conservatory, and it also came up regularly as a meme on X.
- I suspect local men attended my apartment while I was sedated dressed up in superhero outfits or wearing superhero masks to hide their identities.
- I find it curious that `El Pais` ignored the scoop of the millennia, and their servers were controlled by the porn-gangs and so all my emails were blocked and never reached the journalist I had spoken to.
- El Pais has a huge picture of Batman on the outside wall of their offices.
- Does this suggest the whole country is aware that women are being sedated and mass-raped in their own homes by men wearing superhero masks, and no-one cares?

## Horses

- This is a particularly insidious meme.
- While the [switcheroo porn was going on](../crimes/protagonists/vidal-sastre.md#four-distinct-men) at the conservatory over the period between November 2022 and June 2023, I was being tricked into believing there was a love affair going on between myself and the *trumpet teacher* - I had no idea there were a minimum of four men playing this role at the time because I was being drugged every day since February 2022, possibly earlier, without my knowledge.
- The trick was due to the drugging and some sedated-woman-training exercises we have yet to uncover.
- It was reinforced with the [Ana Requena love triangle myth](../timeline/2022/november.md#the-trumpet-teacher) at the conservatory.
- And it was reinforced continually with words and images on my hacked UI through X, Google search, YouTube, and other websites that might be *suggested* to me via hacking.
- A common meme was horses, and this meme was very quickly associated with the man I believed I loved.

![Dark horse](../content/tweets/dark-horse.jpg)

- It turns out, this was an ongoing trigger that had started some time previously for rather sickening reasons.

### Police documentary

- While I was suicidally depressed in 2016, I *stumbled across* a documentary about a woman who had rejoined the police and was undercover filming her colleagues appalling behavior.
- We see two male police officers snickering over a video clip on a WhatsApp group on their phones.
- They tell the female police officer they're looking at a naked woman in a field somewhere running after a horse.
- I was horrified. The attitude of the men to this poor woman in the field was astounding to me. She didn't register as a human being to them at all.
- Later, during the beginnings of the online stalking after I moved back to Denia in 2022, I mentioned this particular video in an X post which I have yet to find.
- Immediately, a fake account replies with the exact film clip, show name, URL even, saying, *Is it this one?*
- I reply *yes*, or similar.
- I now believe that was Hazel, and either herself or her associates had begun triggering me with the horse meme all the way back in 2016.
- I only remember this as significant once the drugging has stopped for a long period and I have remembered the switcheroo men also.

### Samuel is a dark horse

## Jaws

- https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1710011124635070560

- I post about how we delivered the bomb just before I go to class. 
- The single male adult member of my choir class "bumps" into me in the hall. He is looking at me and shaking his head laughing.

[![Delivering the bomb](../content/tweets/memes/we-delivered-the-bomb.png)](https://x.com/1FRGVN/status/1736786105909784644)

## Checked shirts

- There was a whole bunch of men's checked-shirt results on Google search in the early days, after which checked shirts triggered a fear reaction in me.
- Did men wear checked shirts when coming into my apartment to assault me while sedated?

## Sylvia

- This name came up constantly.
- I wonder if it is a code name for the targeted woman?
- My thoughts eventually went to a [French woman, Sylvie, I did know in 2015](../timeline/early-years/2015.md#greek-man-with-a-twitch-and-sylvie) who was surrounded by the Denia body-building massive, i.e. Domingo Cano's friend, and I wonder if people could have been referring to her.
- However, this would mean that people fully engaged in terrorizing me were suddenly finding some heart and trying to warn me about what was going on, especially if some ill has befallen Sylvie, so I expect the connection is coincidence.

## Donatello

- This was a common meme early on whilst the cyber-stalking picked up after 12th June 2023.
- I'd see little pics of the mutant ninja turtle figure, with glasses.
- Sometimes this would be matched with a name, David.
- Later on the images morphed into actual humans.
- I'm guessing it was either related to the hacker dealing with me directly, or..
- It was a demo of one of the common ways they target kids online.

## Ssh

- Obviously, *VSSH* is a rendition of "Ssh", be quiet, but many fake accounts use this meme pictorially.

![Shh 1](../content/images/shh1.jpg)
![Shh 2](../content/images/fake-accounts/list/23.png)

- I wonder if this sort of thing is very effective on the children, mimicking teachers maybe.

## Coffee

- This was an early days phrase repeated at the conservatory and regarding Domingo's repeated [coffee dates](../timeline/early-years/2014.md#first-piano-class-at-the-end-end-of-september) in2014, and requests for them, and my subsequent complaint about this to [Joan Carles](../timeline/early-years/2015.md#joan-carles) when I had zero idea that my apartment was spy-cammed up and men were gaining entry to it without my knowledge.

## Father

- *Father* was a regular repeated *meme* online and at the conservatory.
- Alfonso, the harmony teacher in 2023-24 used it a fair bit. I wonder if Domingo gave him a full and complete explanation of what it referred to. I suspect not.
- I always assumed it was due to the trumpet teacher being the father of two daughters (as I had seen on the Facebook page of [one of the men calling himself Vidal Sastre Sanchez Hornero](../timeline/2022/december.md#chamber-music-classes) in December 2022).
- Obviously, this is not the story that teachers and staff at the conservatory would have had about the trumpet-teacher fake narrative, so it's worth considering why this particular *meme* was important and what it genuinely referred to.
