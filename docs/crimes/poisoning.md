## Sedating

- I believe it is highly likely I was sedated from time-to-time, possibly every Monday night there was a chamber music class.
- People were certainly accessing my apartment without my knowledge to add drugs to my toiletries which would continue to affect me while I was traveling.
- I believe now it is highly likely people came into my flat and assaulted me on camera without my knowledge.
- It's not clear who it was but it was certainly related to my studies at the conservatory in some way.

- It is certain that every time I arrived back from the chamber music class I felt extremely unwell, my kidneys aching, and I had to sleep.
- Also, I had a number of weird dreams and visions that may point to things happening to me while I was unconscious.

### Dreams and visions 

This is a non-exhaustive list of all the dreams or visions I remembered from around that time that seemed very real.

- The trumpet teacher was in the lift with me going up to my flat.
- He was sitting on the settee in my living room watching me do yoga.
- He was standing in front of me watching me do yoga.
- He was in my bed numerous times: once having sex, once sleeping and waking up to see me looking at him at which point he said my name, and one time he was sobbing in my arms.

    - Me and the man who was sobbing in my arms, whoever he is, are in love.
    - The man who said my name looked more like [Patricia's husband](../content/images/p-and-dodgy-bloke-2.PNG). I do hope it wasn't.
    
- He was sitting on my garden furniture on the terrace.
- He was in the kitchen with me, possibly slow dancing.
- Marie Carmen my neighbor was in my flat standing in front of me, poking me in the chest.
- Hazel Smith was in my flat with a man I didn’t know.
- Men I didn’t know were in my flat, sometimes in the bathroom, two or three of them at the same time.

## Substances added in my home

- Into the water I would use for making hot drinks and cooking, and for washing myself.
- Into the air vents via the air conditioning system, upstairs access to which I was never given a key.
- Into my toiletries, food, and water by entering my apartment while I was not there.
- Before I left my apartment in February 2025, my car was severely sprayed as were all my belongings at home, clothes, soft furnishings, even furniture. I know this because I started to get sudden onset rheumatoid arthritis and nose bleeds and I couldn't understand why. The RA is focused on various parts of the body related to the clothes or shoes I'm wearing, or the things I'm touching.
- I thought this RA was yet another autoimmune but when I traveled away from all my belongings for a short time, it cleared up. On returning home, it started up again.
- I'm now throwing everything away or repeat washing it (10 times I'm told is how many times you have to wash such items to get rid of poisons).

### Mandrake

- This is an interesting herb that has been used for poisoning over millennia and grows native in the region.
- It is a psychoactive plant and can induce visions.
- It also makes eyesight blurry and this may explain why I easily thought two different people were the same person.
- It dilates the pupils.
- If taking it long-term, even in small doses, a person may become at risk for glaucoma due to the continuous pupil dilation which can narrow the angles.
- It is extremely easy to get the dose wrong with Mandrake, and over-dosing can cause kidney damage amongst other things.

## Drugged at the conservatory in class

- Powder in my ear.
- Powder on my neck.
- Patches applied without my knowledge.
- Oil-based drugs on the music paper.
- Oil-based drugs on the mobile phone screen.
- Oil-based drugs on the piano keys.

### Upping the dose before class at home

- Water from my flat.
- Food and beverages poisoned in my flat without my knowledge.
- Toiletries.
