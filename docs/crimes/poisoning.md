## Sedating

- I believe it is highly likely I was sedated from time-to-time, possibly every Monday night there was a chamber music class.
- People were certainly accessing my apartment without my knowledge to add drugs to my toiletries which would continue to affect me while I was traveling.
- I believe now it is highly likely people came into my flat and assaulted me on camera without my knowledge.
- It's not clear who it was but it was certainly related to my studies at the conservatory in some way.

- It is certain that every time I arrived back from the chamber music class I felt extremely unwell, my kidneys aching, and I had to sleep.
- Also, I had a number of weird dreams and visions that may point to things happening to me while I was unconscious.

### Dreams and visions 

This is a non-exhaustive list of all the dreams or visions I remembered from around that time that seemed very real.

- The trumpet teacher was in the lift with me going up to my flat.
- He was sitting on the settee in my living room watching me do yoga.
- He was standing in front of me watching me do yoga.
- He was in my bed numerous times: once having sex, once sleeping and waking up to see me looking at him at which point he said my name, and one time he was sobbing in my arms.

!!! tip
    - Me and the man who was sobbing in my arms, whoever he is, are in love.
    - The man who said my name looked more like [Patricia's husband](../content/images/p-and-dodgy-bloke-2.PNG). I do hope it wasn't.
    
- He was sitting on my garden furniture on the terrace.
- He was in the kitchen with me, possibly slow dancing.
- Marie Carmen my neighbor was in my flat standing in front of me, poking me in the chest.
- Hazel Smith was in my flat with a man I didn’t know.
- Men I didn’t know were in my flat, sometimes in the bathroom, two or three of them at the same time.

## Substances added in my home

- Into the water I would use for making hot drinks and cooking, and for washing myself.
- Into the air vents via the air conditioning system, upstairs access to which I was never given a key.
- Into my toiletries, food, and water by entering my apartment while I was not there.
- Before I left my apartment in February 2025, my car was severely sprayed as were all my belongings at home, clothes, soft furnishings, even furniture. I know this because I started to get sudden onset rheumatoid arthritis and nose bleeds and I couldn't understand why. The RA is focused on various parts of the body related to the clothes or shoes I'm wearing, or the things I'm touching.
- I thought this RA was yet another autoimmune but when I traveled away from all my belongings for a short time, it cleared up. On returning home, it started up again.
- I'm now throwing everything away or repeat washing it (10 times I'm told is how many times you have to wash such items to get rid of poisons).

### Puffs and squeaks

- From July 2023, I regularly heard two significant noises in my home.
- Usually I would hear these noises around lunchtimes, from about 1.30pm, when I was resting and perhaps online on the sofa.
- Sometimes, I heard them in the evenings too.
- I only heard these noises when I was sitting resting on the sofa, often with my laptop on my belly and browsing X.

#### Regular puffs

- Short regular puffing noises, like a short breath of air.
- I heard these every 15 minutes or so during lunchtimes.
- They were just like a pest mechanism which blows some gas into the air that kills mosquitoes.
- I can describe it like that because I have just been hearing exactly the same thing in the hotel I'm staying at.
- But, unlike continual puffs, I remember hearing two or three maximum, and no more.

#### Squeaks

- At the same times, and in the same place (the sofa), I would hear the water pipes to the sink squeaking as if they were being manipulated.
- These pipes were lose because the tap was extendable.
- The sounds was much like the sound the pipes made when I extended them, but it always sounded like the noise was coming from behind the wall.
- When I heard these in 2022 and 2023, I thought it must be cockroaches in the pipes and this is why I was so adamant with my landlady about why I was feeling sick all the time and why I needed a new fridge. The original fridge was easily 30 years old.

### Mandrake

- This is an interesting herb that has been used for poisoning over millennia and grows native in the region.
- It is a psychoactive plant and can induce visions.
- It also makes eyesight blurry and this may explain why I easily thought two different people were the same person.
- It dilates the pupils.
- If taking it long-term, even in small doses, a person may become at risk for glaucoma due to the continuous pupil dilation which can narrow the angles.
- It is extremely easy to get the dose wrong with Mandrake, and over-dosing can cause kidney damage amongst other things.
- I expect that I was being dosed with whatever it was way back in December 2022 in Thailand, while I was fasting and detoxing, and this also could have been a lethal overdose and probably explains the seizure I had.

## Drugged at the conservatory in class

- Powder in my ear.
- Powder on my neck.
- Patches applied without my knowledge.
- Oil-based drugs on the music paper.
- Oil-based drugs on the mobile phone screen.
- Oil-based drugs on the piano keys.

### Upping the dose before class at home

- Water from my flat.
- Food and beverages poisoned in my flat without my knowledge.
- Toiletries.
