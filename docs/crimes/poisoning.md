## Sedating

- I believe it is highly likely I was sedated from time-to-time, possibly every Monday night there was a chamber music class.
- People were certainly accessing my apartment without my knowledge to add drugs to my toiletries which would continue to affect me while I was traveling.
- I believe now it is highly likely people came into my flat and assaulted me on camera without my knowledge.
- It is certain that every time I arrived back from the chamber music class I felt extremely unwell, my kidneys aching, and I had to sleep.
- Also, I had a number of weird dreams and visions that may point to things happening to me while I was unconscious.

### Dreams and visions 

This is a non-exhaustive list of all the dreams or visions I remembered from around that time that seemed very real.

- The trumpet teacher was in the lift with me going up to my flat.
- He was sitting on the settee in my living room watching me do yoga.
- He was standing in front of me watching me do yoga.
- He was in my bed numerous times: once having sex, once sleeping and waking up to see me looking at him at which point he said my name, and one time he was sobbing in my arms.
- He was sitting on my garden furniture on the terrace.
- He was in the kitchen with me, possibly slow dancing.
- Marie Carmen my neighbor was in my flat standing in front of me, poking me in the chest.
- Hazel Smith was in my flat with a man I didn’t know.
- Men I didn’t know were in my flat, sometimes in the bathroom, two or three of them at the same time.
