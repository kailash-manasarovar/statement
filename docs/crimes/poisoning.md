## Distraction techniques before application

- Apart from being drugged and poisoned in my own home - criminals coming into apply poison whenever I was out, or regular poisoning via the water mains and air vents - I was also targeted in public.
- A poisoner operating in a public place, like a school or the street, will use a distraction technique on the target before applying the poison in powder form to available skin; behind the ear, on the arm, back of the neck, etc. 
- Care must be take regarding the hairstyle of the person (mine was very short at the time) and whether it covers the ears, and what the person is wearing.
- Poison or drug application in a setting in which the target is together with the poisoner for a length of time is easier and can be done with dissolving skin patches. I suspect this is probably how a teacher might poison a student, especially a child.
- The following situations are events in which I was poisoned or drugged in Denia and the distraction techniques I noticed.
- Regarding drugging at the conservatory, it seems extraordinarily reckless to be administering drugs and poisons to targets in the presence of minor children who may accidentally ingest some.
- I guess that's a testament to how little respect these people have for human life.

### A small beautiful child

- In [April 2024](../timeline/2024/april.md#the-trumpet-teacher-in-denia), I am targeted by a small gypsy family as I leave the Chinese restaurant.
- As I'm walking towards the tunnel, they are in front of me walking slowly.
- There are three or four adults and a small child; one older male with long grey hair and a beard and two or three younger women.
- The child is about three with long blond curly hair and blue eyes. She's startlingly beautiful.
- The group are walking so slowly, I have to pass them.
- After I have passed them, and I am about two metres away, the tiny beautiful child runs up beside me on my right and I look at her and say hi.
- At this moment, one of the others will have administered drugs in spray powder form or patch to the back of my neck or bare arm on my left side.
- The child runs back.
- From here, I continue walking towards the restaurant where they have a trumpet-teacher-shaped man sitting with his back to me. This is to trigger a physical memory of *my love* while I'm becoming effected by the drugs.
- I walk past the man uninterested.
- I nearly get to the tunnel and the drugs take hold.
- My pace slows and I start thinking about the trumpet teacher again.
- Maybe that night I was sedated and raped at home too.
- This would have prepped me for the [Polygon conference in Bali](../timeline/2024/may.md#bali) and explains the [frantic hacker and stalker activity in Madrid](../timeline/2024/may.md#madrid) prior to my leaving for Bali.

### Crowd on the conservatory stairs

- It was essential that I was high at chamber music class on the sporadic occasions the trumpet teacher turned up.
- I believe the distraction technique was a physically close crowd of people surrounding me on the stairs or in reception when I arrived for class.
- It would be very easy in this situation to apply powder to the neck or ears.
- While the substance would have been aphrodisiac and euphoria-creating while the chamber music classes were going on prior to June 12th 2023, afterwards, when I returned to my studies in September, the substance would have been something that made me anxious and stressed.
- I remember being euphoric and highly sexually aroused in other classes, like choir for example.
- It's not clear for what purpose they would drug me in other classes unless they were simply keeping me high continually while I had yet to foil their evil plans.
- I rarely felt this way in harmony class.
- I remember feeling this way once in piano class with Maria when [I told her that I was on fire](../timeline/2023/march.md#piano-classes).

### In chamber music class

- I assume the trumpet teacher himself must have also had the responsibility of drugging or poisoning me.
- It was interesting that Pablo was *always* 10 minutes late to class.
- During those 10 minutes, perhaps the drugs administered on the stairs were taking hold properly, or the trumpet teacher himself may have applied some dry powder to the back of my ear or neck.
- I don't remember there being a situation where that could have happened, unless he waited till Pablo came and I was sitting down at the piano with my back to everyone and he applied it then.
- If so, it's possible Pablo saw this happening.
- There were occasions when he asked me to hold something; his phone for example, or the piano sheet music he would go and photocopy with Gloria and sometimes take a long time doing so.
- Whenever he brought the papers back, he only held them at the top corner.
- I wondered if some substance could be administered through the skin in those situations.
- It seems unlikely that Pablo, and other children, did not get affected by the illegal substances in these scenarios.

### Blowing in my face

- I am walking towards the tunnel on [Wednesday 13th March 2024](../timeline/2024/march/13-end.md#wednesday-13th-march) after choir.
- A man with long blond hair is coming out of the tunnel as I am walking in.
- He walks right up to me grinning and blows in my face.
- I would recognize this man again and believe I may have photos of him as a boy.
- I fall sick with a chest infection the next day which quickly becomes very bad.
- I have this chest infection for nearly three weeks until I see the doctor in Mumbai who prescribes me hardcore antibiotics and medicine for pleurisy.
- I cough so hard in India, I crack a rib. 
- The doc says I probably have pneumonia.
- My friend Yan can confirm as I could not stop coughing until the medicine started to work.
- It's not clear if I was drugged with a substance intended to make me very ill, or on this particular night I was assaulted extremely violently in my home by this man and others, and the chest infection was a physical reaction to sedated abuse I'm consciously unaware of.
- This has been common with me throughout my life; I get chest infections as a reaction to trauma.
- I was asthmatic throughout my childhood.

### Adjusting a child's rucksack

- On [Tuesday 12th March 2024](../timeline/2024/march/1-12.md#tuesday-12th-march) I see Domingo adjusting a very small child's rucksack on the stairs going into the conservatory.
- He has his hands on the straps and he is helping the child of about 5 or 6-years-old, possibly younger, adjust them.
- He puts his hands on the child's shoulders, neck, head, and arms.
- As his hands are on the child's shoulders, neck, and head, Domingo looks meaningfully at me.
- I expect he was demonstrating to me at that moment how he drugs children.

## Sedating

- I believe it is highly likely I was sedated from time-to-time, possibly every Monday night there was a chamber music class.
- People were certainly accessing my apartment without my knowledge to add drugs to my toiletries which would continue to affect me while I was traveling.
- I believe now it is highly likely people came into my flat and assaulted me on camera without my knowledge.
- It's not clear who it was but it was certainly related to my studies at the conservatory in some way.

![Sedating me and coming into my room](../content/images/sedating/sedating-0.png)

- It is certain that every time I arrived back from the chamber music class I felt extremely unwell, my kidneys aching, and I had to sleep.
- Also, I had a number of weird dreams and visions that may point to things happening to me while I was unconscious.

### Dreams and visions 

This is a non-exhaustive list of all the dreams or visions I remembered from around that time that seemed very real.

- The trumpet teacher was in the lift with me going up to my flat.
- He was sitting on the settee in my living room watching me do yoga.
- He was standing in front of me watching me do yoga.
- He was in my bed numerous times: once having sex, once sleeping and waking up to see me looking at him at which point he said my name, and one time he was sobbing in my arms.

!!! tip
    - Me and the man who was sobbing in my arms, whoever he is, are in love.
    - The man who said my name looked more like [Patricia's husband](../content/images/p-and-dodgy-bloke-2.PNG). I do hope it wasn't.
    
- He was sitting on my garden furniture on the terrace.
- He was in the kitchen with me, possibly slow dancing.
- Marie Carmen my neighbor was in my flat standing in front of me, poking me in the chest.
- Hazel Smith was in my flat with a man I didn’t know.
- She may have been wearing a top hat and circus outfit, this is vague.
- Men I didn’t know were in my flat, sometimes in the bathroom, two or three of them at the same time.

## Substances added in my home

- Into the water I would use for making hot drinks and cooking, and for washing myself.
- Into the air vents via the air conditioning system, upstairs access to which I was never given a key.
- Into my toiletries, food, and water by entering my apartment while I was not there.
- Before I left my apartment in February 2025, my car was severely sprayed as were all my belongings at home, clothes, soft furnishings, even furniture. I know this because I started to get sudden onset rheumatoid arthritis and nose bleeds and I couldn't understand why. The RA is focused on various parts of the body related to the clothes or shoes I'm wearing, or the things I'm touching.
- I thought this RA was yet another autoimmune but when I traveled away from all my belongings for a short time, it cleared up. On returning home, it started up again.
- I'm now throwing everything away or repeat washing it (10 times I'm told is how many times you have to wash such items to get rid of poisons).

### Puffs and squeaks

- From July 2023, I regularly heard two significant noises in my home.
- Usually I would hear these noises around lunchtimes, from about 1.30pm, when I was resting and perhaps online on the sofa.
- Sometimes, I heard them in the evenings too.
- I only heard these noises when I was sitting resting on the sofa, often with my laptop on my belly and browsing X.

#### Regular puffs

- Short regular puffing noises, like a short breath of air.
- I heard these every 15 minutes or so during lunchtimes.
- They were just like a pest mechanism which blows some gas into the air that kills mosquitoes.
- I can describe it like that because I have just been hearing exactly the same thing in the hotel I'm staying at.
- But, unlike continual puffs, I remember hearing two or three maximum, and no more.

#### Squeaks

- At the same times, and in the same place (the sofa), I would hear the water pipes to the sink squeaking as if they were being manipulated.
- These pipes were lose because the tap was extendable.
- The sounds was much like the sound the pipes made when I extended them, but it always sounded like the noise was coming from behind the wall.
- When I heard these in 2022 and 2023, I thought it must be cockroaches in the pipes and this is why I was so adamant with my landlady about why I was feeling sick all the time and why I needed a new fridge. The original fridge was easily 30 years old.

### Mandrake

- This is an interesting herb that has been used for poisoning over millennia and grows native in the region.
- It is a psychoactive plant and can induce visions.
- It also makes eyesight blurry and this may explain why I easily thought two different people were the same person.
- It dilates the pupils.
- If taking it long-term, even in small doses, a person may become at risk for glaucoma due to the continuous pupil dilation which can narrow the angles.
- It is extremely easy to get the dose wrong with Mandrake, and over-dosing can cause kidney damage amongst other things.
- I expect that I was being dosed with whatever it was way back in December 2022 in Thailand, while I was fasting and detoxing, and this also could have been a lethal overdose and probably explains the seizure I had.

## Drugged at the conservatory in class

- Powder in my ear.
- Powder on my neck.
- Patches applied without my knowledge.
- Oil-based drugs on the music paper.
- Oil-based drugs on the mobile phone screen.
- Oil-based drugs on the piano keys.

### Upping the dose before class at home

- Water from my flat.
- Food and beverages poisoned in my flat without my knowledge.
- Toiletries.
