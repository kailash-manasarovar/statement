!!! tip
    - See the [list of teachers here](../timeline/early-years/2015.md#first-class-of-january) and their twitter (fake) account pics.

## Domingo and Carmen Lopez Cano

- Key figures in the attacks.
- Given their name relates to all things canine and wolverine, any reference online to dogs, particularly when it also is content of a threatening or abusive nature, is interesting and suggests it is coming from them and their family.
- Dogs feature constantly in the online harassment and threats.

### Carmen Cano

- I believe Carmen Cano ran many fake accounts that terrorized me.
- A picture of her was posted on my Google searches which I screen shot in April.

- I have never met Carmen Cano but it's obvious that the picture of this woman has been merged with the face of Domingo Cano.
- I have another picture of her from a body cam I was wearing on 5th October. I went out without my mobile phone to go for a walk along Las Rota in Denia. I didn't want to be followed and tracked, but I wanted to still have means to call the police, so I brought my [analogue phone that I had bought in April](../timeline/2024/april.md#i-get-an-orange-sim). As I approached the restaurant Sendra, a woman cycles up behind me, then in front of me, she stops, smiles, and cycles off. It was Carmen Cano for sure. She looked a lot like the pics I have just posted. I have this on camera.

!!! info
    - It seems like even 2g phones are trackable by these people.

- On 1st November, the same woman is leaving my apartment building with another dark haired lady; a woman I have often seen going in and out of apartment number 18 next door to me since I got back to Denia from France at the end of April.

## The trumpet teacher

- I do not believe this man's name is Vidal Sastre Sanchez Hornero, unless, of course, these criminal gangs are so arrogant and protected, they don't bother hiding themselves.
- Symbols and memes related to him are horses, Trump.
- He has a brother who may be a twin as they look nearly identical: the brother "made himself known to me" one evening when I walked through the tunnel during the intensive gang stalking in October 2023.
- Trish Penny, when I asked her how she knew Vidal, said "who"? But it's clear she knows who this man is, and his brother.
- Investigators will know immediately who he is.
- The whole town of Denia and beyond knows who he is.

## Twitter accounts of note

- `@jctot19`: I believe this must be the trumpet teacher's account although could be being controlled/managed by others too.
- `@sinremite`: I believe this is Carmen Cano's account.
