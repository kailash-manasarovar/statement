## Domingo and Carmen Lopez Cano

- Key figures in the attack.
- Given their name relates to all things canine, any reference online to dogs, particularly when it also is content of a threatening or abusive nature, is interesting.
- Dogs feature constantly in the online harassment and threats.

## The trumpet teacher

- I do not believe this man's name is Vidal Sastre Sanchez Hornero, unless, of course, these criminal gangs are so arrogant and protected, they don't bother hiding themselves.
- Symbols related to him are horses.
- He has a brother who may be a twin as they look nearly identical: the brother "made himself known to me" one evening when I walked through the tunnel during the intensive gang stalking in October 2023.
- Trish Penny, when I asked her how she knew Vidal, said "who"? But it's clear she knows who this man is, and his brother.
- Investigators will know immediately who he is.
- The whole town of Denia and beyond knows who he is.

## Twitter accounts of note

- `@jctot19`: I believe this must be the trumpet teacher's account although could be being controlled/managed by others too.
- `@sinremite`: I believe this is Carmen Cano's account.
