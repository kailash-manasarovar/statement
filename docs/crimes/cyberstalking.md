## Twitter and other social networks

- Accounts can be renamed, both name and account name.
- Accounts can be stripped of all content, and remade in a different way.
- One account can be duplicated into another.
- Fake accounts are available at the click of a button.
- I think there must be the following sorts of algorithms available:
    - Track {example-account} and follow with {example-sentiment} where example-account = whoever they're stalking/tracking/honey trapping, and example-sentiment can be romance, sex, fear, violence, etc.
- For honey trappers, there must be search algorithms for vulnerable accounts and you can see some of that in posts.
