# Hacking

- Imagine realizing that every single thing you do online is watched intently by criminal gangs; from every payment you make online, to every email you write, to every post you like on X.
- Now imagine that you realize, also, that the same criminal gangs are tracking your every move on location software; either the software you use yourself, or the software that they have downloaded onto your devices for their own purposes.
- Not only that, but when they decided they really want to upset you, they can turn off your location software, or scramble it, while you're in the busiest motorway in a capital city you are not familiar with.
- They have shown you that they have functioning key-loggers on your devices, so that anything you write is recorded.
- They have shown you that they have unlimited access to your social media UIs, meaning they can tailor content specifically for you, to upset or manipulate, to send messages, or worse.
- They have shown you that they have access to your mobile and laptop cameras, and they suggest, also, that they have cameras in your apartment set up to film anything going on in the bed, the sofa, the bathroom, everywhere.
- Now imagine you go to the Spanish police about this, with names and details, and they tell you that you have to prove it before they'll investigate.
- You tell them it is related to public school attendance, that teachers and staff who look after children are involved, and that multiple vulnerable children may be in danger.
- They tell you you're ugly, and that's why you've been targeted online.
- You tell the British police because well-known British criminals are involved, and multiple children are in danger.
- They come round and tell you you're an idiot for twenty minutes, then leave.
- True story.

## Common hacking activities

- A silly example, but as I was trying to download a file (my X archive) for Chris BJ one Sunday afternoon that I was going to bring to her, and I told her at that time, April 2024 or so, that if anything happened to me, here's my X archive, so she knew I was afraid for my life, and then repeatedly downplayed everything afterwards as if it was nothing, and then said "why don't you leave?" as if it wasn't just nothing.
- The download was blocked and took an extraordinary long time. This is an easy hack on Mac OS with the Spotlight tool.

## Flashes on screen

- I'll be looking at X and the screen will flash as if some other page flashed up at me but it was so quick I couldn't see what it was.
- I wonder if it is subliminal images and perhaps it's saved to the caches of my machine.

## X access

- While I'm using X, the screen will sometimes bubble and images will disappear, and then it will bubble up again with new content and, quite often, at the very top, will be a hacker account with a "significant" message.
