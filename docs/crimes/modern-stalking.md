## Then and now

Modern stalking for criminal purposes uses typical traditional bullying and gang-stalking tactics together with cyberstalking, especially of a target's social media accounts. Depending on the circumstances, and how valuable the target is, to make it extremely unlikely a target has the power to escape, the criminal gangs will use drugging and poisoning tactics too.

As we have seen by my experience, [drugging is now taking place in the classroom](../timeline/2023/january.md#poisoning).

Vast gangs of people are employed on social media by criminal gangs with the remit of hunting down vulnerable people for targeting. These people could be:

- Young women (and some men) targeted for porn and sexual grooming online, then blackmail and exploitation.
- Children targeted for pedophile porn and sexual grooming; blackmail and exploitation may come when the target is grown up.
- Wealthy individuals targeted by confidence tricksters in the guise of romantic partners who, depending on the situation, enrich themselves and the gang they work for via the generosity of the target, family legacies, and threats whenever the target is sufficiently groomed and fearful.

### Children and young women

These targets will be tricked into believing someone is interested in them romantically, or as a friend if they're children. From here they are tricked into sending nudes and sexually explicit pictures. 

If the target can be tracked physically, it is highly likely that gangs will do so, drugging their victims and enriching themselves with more pornography which they can use later on for blackmail and exploitation. 

Oftentimes, young people targeted in this way where there is some actual physical relationship involved will be coerced and/or drugged into being the victim of extreme sexual violence, i.e. the porn genres which make criminal gangs the most money.

## Targets for social media stalking

Criminal gangs operate large numbers of stalker accounts that they delegate to their workforce. Some accounts are operational around the clock.

These accounts look extremely legitimate and post regular updates that give them the appearance of normality.

In areas where the wealthier people speak non-native languages, people speaking these languages will be targeted by the criminal gangs to participate in the confidence tricks and grooming online. 

We might call this a new form of modern slavery/trafficking.

## Targeting particularly generous groups

Particularly generous groups, such as middle-aged British women, are special targets for criminal gangs.

Once a fake account has created enough "confidence" in the wider group they are a part of online, they will invent a situation in which they can request money from the group.

These "situations" could be related to health, or family, generally anything which may invoke a "feeling sorry for" reaction in the targeted group.

Criminals can make huge amounts of money in this way for many years before anyone raises the alarm.

## Being OK about all of this

Given that I have been to the Spanish and UK police numerous times about personal suffering in this regard, and within a public school context, I can only assume the following:

1. **No one cares about abused women and children in Spain.**
