## Local business

### Thao Qi acupuncture

- Thao seemed to be deeply embedded in the conspiracy and I believe was doing as she was told, and passing me onto medics who would diagnose diabetes or something equally serious.
- https://www.thaoqi.com/
- See [my experience with her](../timeline/2023/may.md#acupuncture-with-thao-qi).

### Dentist

- I believe the dentist at Ameba knew exactly who I was, and may have even already known me intimately, perhaps from the Denia TV specials.
- https://www.adentaria.com/
- See [my experience here](../timeline/2022/november.md#dentist).

### Denia medical centre

- https://www.cemclinicas.com/centro-medico-denia
- The nurse who worked here was a [close associate of Domingo](../timeline/early-years/2015.md#domingo-pretends-he-has-another-girlfriend).
- The doctor I saw to look at my ingrown toenail in June 2023, I believe to have known me intimately, and may even be on my security cam video [from the beach on 6th October 2024](../timeline/2024/october.md#sunday-6th-october).
- To be fair, if I was on Denia TV each week sedated, everyone knew me intimately.

### Foreign desk at the council

- Enric Gil ran the foreigners welcoming desk at the local council and has an office there.
- He was [extremely unhelpful](../timeline/2024/march.md#enric-gil) when I was in dire need of assistance in March 2024, and seemed to be laughing at me.
- I wonder if his job including telling criminals about new arrivals and whether anyone was "vulnerable"; i.e. old, alone and female, very rich, etc.

## Locals

### Mercedes Correas Lara

- Domingo's associate.
- I believe Domingo required her to go to the Orfeo de Denia choir and "meet" me there.
