## wip

- I suspect gang-stalking in Spain is well-known to the Spaniard and part of a old tradition of targeting a single woman for persecution.
- It's not so difficult to assume a culture that celebrates terrorizing animals might do the same with women and children.
- The Spanish have always been known as a culture that loves and cares for their families and children.
- What happened?
- I suspect porn happened to Spanish men and they lost their minds completely.
- At the same time, criminal gangs saw an opportunity in such a lost society and snapped it up immediately.
- I suspect the spy-cam and sedating epidemic is countrywide.
- Might dealing with it properly in one small area send a healing shockwave to the rest of the country?
