## Mac spoofing

- This is how I believe they accessed all my devices and I believe they did it with the help of the telecommunications companies because reformating my laptop never kept them out.
- Once in, they just dropped audio, visual, screen recorder spy apps and key loggers and everything I do online is surveilled sometimes in realtime.
- I wonder if there is some kind of subliminal spy app that can trigger emotions.
- I believe my devices will reveal this when examined in a formal manner, i.e. by the security services and not me having to find someone to do it for me.

## Common hacking activities

- I was trying to download a file (Twitter archive) for Chris BJ and I told her at that time, April 2024 or so, that if anything happened to me, here's my Twitter archive, so she knew I was afraid for my life and then repeatedly downplayed everything afterwards.
- The download was blocked and took an extraordinary long time. I think this is an easy hack on Mac OS with the Spotlight tool.

## Flashes on screen

- I'll be looking at Twitter and the screen will flash as if there was some other page flashed up at me but it was so quick I couldn't see what it was.
- I wonder what's in the caches of my machine.

## Twitter access

- While I'm using Twitter, the screen will sometimes bubble and images will disappear, and then it will bubble up again with new content and, quite often, at the top will be a hacker account.

## Effect on me

- When I think about how long Domingo Cano and his associates had access to my cameras without my knowledge, and how often I must have been wondering around naked, or doing intimate things in my home that no one should have been watching, I feel really extremely upset.
- I hope that police find evidence, and make arrests, and that people go to jail, I really do.
- It most certainly won't just be me either.
