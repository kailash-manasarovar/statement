## Mac spoofing

## Flashes on screen

- I'll be looking at Twitter and the screen will flash as if there was some other page flashed up at me but it was so quick I couldn't see what it was.
- I wonder what's in the caches of my machine.

## Twitter access

- While I'm using Twitter, the screen will sometimes bubble and images will disappear, and then it will bubble up again with new content and, quite often, at the top will be a hacker account.
