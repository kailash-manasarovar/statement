## Mac spoofing

## Flashes on screen

- I'll be looking at Twitter and the screen will flash as if there was some other page flashed up at me but it was so quick I couldn't see what it was.
- I wonder what's in the caches of my machine.

## Twitter access

- While I'm using Twitter, the screen will sometimes bubble and images will disappear, and then it will bubble up again with new content and, quite often, at the top will be a hacker account.

## Effect on me

- When I think about how long Domingo Cano and his associates had access to my cameras without my knowledge, and how often I must have been wondering around naked, or doing intimate things in my home that no one should have been watching, I feel really extremely upset.
- I hope that police find evidence, and make arrests, and that people go to jail, I really do.
- It most certainly won't just be me either.
