## Gaining access to my online devices

- I believe hackers accessed all my devices and I believe they did it with the help of the telecommunications companies because reformating my laptop never kept them out. 
- The telecommunication companies only have to share private router MAC addresses with hackers in order for them to gain access.
- Whenever I reformated a device to factory settings, as soon as I logged into my home network, they were back in again.
- This means that multiple parties probably had root access to all my devices.
- They would have had access to every single thing I did online, and offline too as key-loggers would record my activities.
- Sometimes, when changing a root password on my laptop, the hackers might repeat the new password to me the next morning via fake X accounts.
- Once they accessed a device via router access, they could do whatever they wanted such as downloading audio, visual, screen recorder spy apps and key loggers onto my devices. They could also download programs that would reconnect back out to the hackers if I was not at home, so on any network at all.
- This meant that everything I do/did online would be surveilled, sometimes in realtime.
- It also meant they could track my movements via location apps on my mobile phones.
- I wonder if there is some kind of subliminal spy app that can trigger emotions with sound, or maybe enhance already "medicated" or "pharmaceutically mood altered" emotions.
- With access like this, it is very easy to have actual conversations with a target through various methods (in my case fake account profile text) in real time.
- My hacked devices have the evidence to prove such illicit access.

## Common hacking activities

- A silly example, but as I was trying to download a file (my X archive) for Chris BJ one Sunday afternoon that I was going to bring to her, and I told her at that time, April 2024 or so, that if anything happened to me, here's my X archive, so she knew I was afraid for my life, and then repeatedly downplayed everything afterwards as if it was nothing, and then said "why don't you leave?" as if it wasn't just nothing.
- The download was blocked and took an extraordinary long time. This is an easy hack on Mac OS with the Spotlight tool.

## Flashes on screen

- I'll be looking at X and the screen will flash as if some other page flashed up at me but it was so quick I couldn't see what it was.
- I wonder if it is subliminal images and perhaps it's saved to the caches of my machine.

## X access

- While I'm using X, the screen will sometimes bubble and images will disappear, and then it will bubble up again with new content and, quite often, at the very top, will be a hacker account with a "significant" message.

## Effect on me

- When I think about how long Domingo the piano teacher and his family and associates had access to my private home life without my knowledge, and how often I must have been wondering around naked, or doing intimate things in my home that no one should have been watching, I feel really extremely upset and violated.
- When I consider that he and the men of Denia also had access to documents and personal information of an extraordinarily personal nature, I'm sickened.
- I hope that police investigate properly, get the evidence they need, and make arrests, and that people go to jail, I really do.
- I'm sure my experience is the tip of an enormous iceberg.
