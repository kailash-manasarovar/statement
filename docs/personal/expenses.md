## Hotels 

It is impossible for me to feel safe in Dénia. I believe my life is in danger in Dénia and probably throughout Spain and even beyond.

I've nowhere else to go however. London is complicated. I'm going to be homeless when I leave Dénia which, for me, is very upsetting and worrying.

I will have to go back to London at least temporarily and this has been an extremely difficult place for me as my parents and brother have consistently downplayed anything that's happened to me over the years as unimportant, or my fault somehow.

The things they say to me concerning me being the victim of child sexual abuse and rape have really been abhorrent at times.

Living with my family is the main reason I became suicidally depressed after reporting child sexual abuse and rape to the Metropolitan police in 2016.

So there has been no safe place to go and I have had to stay in hotels a lot instead of my home.

### Update

- I moved back to London in February 2025.

## Rent

- I take enormous exception at having paid monthly rent to criminal gangs who were poisoning, drugging, and filming me in my apartment.
- I'd like it all paid back. I wasn't paying rent to be murdered or driven to suicide or to make pornographers rich.
- It's around 21,000 EURs paid to three different accounts.
- I believe the first account was probably Bea's, the apparent landlady, but given she was so angry it was more likely paid directly to the trumpet teacher and Domingo who were managing the murderous plot initially.
- I believe the second account, [changed in August 2022](../timeline/2022/july.md#the-landlady-changes-the-bank-account-for-the-rent) was probably paid directly to Domingo and the trumpet teacher gang, with some syphoned off to Paqui most likely when she took over.
- The third account, [changed in August 2024](../timeline/2024/august.md#the-landlady-changes-the-bank-account-for-the-rent-again), was very likely Carmen Cano's or whoever was tasked with murdering me by poison in October 2024 when Paqui's plot failed.
- It won't be hard to find out.

## Poisoned clothes, belongings, and car

- I'm estimating at least 10,000 EUR of clothes, toiletries, furniture, and belongings I have had to jettison because it is perilous to touch.
- This includes the car which I have had detailed once, but clearly will need further cleaning.

## Lost work

- I lost three jobs during this period. The first two, I believe, I lost due to the stress I was under while I was being drugged and stalked online and in Dénia.
- The third was unfair dismissal which I'm going to court about.
- Due to my [cognitive loss](health.md#cognitive-loss), I'm pretty sure I would struggle to maintain the same level of jobs I have been working for over the last 10 years.
- My losses here are incalculable really. 
- Prior to December 2022, I was doing extremely well at my work in a cognitive sense.

## Estimated money earned by pornographers

- Given the amount of people involved in the plot and how there was no way they weren't getting paid for it, there will be numerous revenue streams coming into Dénia's pornographers and sex gang accounts.
- The original porn from 1989 has been live for over 30 years.
- I also believe that, given porn just gets more and more boring for consumers and they always need something more, something extra perverted, I believe consumers are now able to interact with spy cam targets via their social media and this is controlled by criminal gangs.
- I believe many of the accounts that followed me and stalked me on X from September 2023 onwards will be men paying a subscription for interaction with a woman they have already been paying to watch in her own home, and be raped repeatedly while sedated without her knowledge.

### 1989 porn

- Incalculable. Certainly the porn that Winston May and his associates made of me in 1989 will have made many millions of pounds over the last 35 years. Furthermore, when Domingo the piano teacher, Hazel Smith, and their associates found this porn, they would likely have been reselling it, and certainly in lieu of the "reenactment" they had planned, as a taster.
- I believe I was live-streamed at my apartment masturbating, again in lieu of a "reenactment" I suspect, but also because I managed to foil their evil plot and they had to sell something.
- I believe I was sedated in my apartment and people came into to abuse me, all filmed and live streamed to paying customers.
- I believe the money they made on all of this is in the tens of millions.
- In the way that these people are really keen for you to know what they're doing at your expense cos it must give them a little kick; with a little hint there, a word here, little visual or statement, etc., the cars that drove past my house, beeping and taunting me, were expensive, fast, and new. 

#### Estimate

- 10 million.

### 2022-2024 spy-cam porn

- Men really are disgusting and it would not surprise me at all if they were prepared to pay considerably for continued access to my apartment via spy cam.
- They would have, of course, had to pay extra for the times sex abusers entered and molested me while sedated.

#### Estimate

- 10 million.

### Subscriptions for interacting with a live spy-cam target

- These probably were offered around in September 2023 and 1000s may have subscribed.
- Many of these men interacted with me on X.

#### Estimate

- 10 million.
