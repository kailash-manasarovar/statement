## Psychological effects

- My mind has been battered with NLP/MRA seduction techniques and porn symbolism since, at least, April 2023.
- This may have had only little effect if it hadn't been coupled with some kind of narcotic substance.
- I can't imagine how young girls deal with this. It must truly overwhelm them.
- Are they doing it to minors too? Well, why wouldn't they if they? 
- They can do anything they want and no one will do anything about it.
- And, furthermore, they've been utterly obsessed with my child sexual abuse experience for nearly 10 years.
- If the wall of silence continues, they will just get worse, and they're monstrous as it is.
- What's next? 
- All silence is complicit.

### Negative effects

- My mind feels utterly polluted with porn and unhealthy sexual ideas. This is more so if I am feeling aroused. These thoughts are not my own. It's horrible.

### Positive effects

- Ironically, whatever NLP plus medication combo they were using on me healed me of depression. I thought it was love, and it probably was a little bit, but the real trigger was the drugs and sexual feelings in the context of love that I hadn't had for over a decade.
