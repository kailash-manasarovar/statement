## Mind

- My mind feels utterly polluted with porn and unhealthy sexual ideas. This is more so if I am feeling aroused. These thoughts are not my own. It's horrible.
- Ironically, whatever NLP plus medication combo they were using on me healed me of depression. I thought it was love, and it probably was a little bit, but the real trigger was the drugs and sexual feelings in the context of love that I hadn't had for over a decade.
