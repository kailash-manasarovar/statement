## Stress

## PTSD

## Hair narcotic test

- On the 5th November 2024, at AlphaBioLabs in London, I undertook the 12 month hair analysis for narcotics.
- The results came back negative.

## Heavy metal analysis

- On 11th November 2024, at Medex in Bangkok, I undertook the comprehensive heavy metal and toxicology blood tests.
- Everything came back normal.

## Kidneys

- Since December 2022, when the trumpet teacher began at the conservatory,  I have had trouble with my kidneys, particularly the right one.
- At Christmas 2022, I had a seizure of some sort in Samui on holiday and I went to A&E at Bangkok Hospital. They told me everything was fine, it was just panic, but nevertheless I had frothy urine for a few days after that.
- On 28th January, I got a mild form of rhabdo at chamber music class with the trumpet teacher.
- I suffered frothy urine and other ill effects after that for some time.
- I went on a strict kidney diet, lost a lot of weight (15kg) and the urine problem became intermittent.
- I went to my GP in Denia for a blood test to check for kidney failure markers. They did a blood test for everything and skipped the kidney function test. There was no explanation why.
- I went to the pharmacy in Denia to do a DIY creatinine test. They never had one available. It was not clear why.
- The frothy urine and pain in my kidney area always comes back hard if I'm unwell. So, for example, when I had Covid in May 2023, my kidneys were battered from it. This was also true when I had the serious chest infection from 13th March to 5th April where I even cracked a rib coughing. I also became unwell in August 2024 with a chest infection. During these times I had frothy urine and back pain all the time.
- My urine became frothy again whenever I was back in Denia living at Carrer Furs.
- On 12th November 2024, at Bangkok Hospital, I undertook the comprehensive kidney analysis tests.
- Everything was normal except for anion gap which was low.

- I continue to have daily pain in my kidney area but no froth in urine at the time of writing.

## Eyes

- On 17th March 2022, I went for a regular eye check up at [Alain Afflelou in Ondara](https://www.afflelou.es/opticas/ondara/afflelou-c-c-portal-de-la-marina-av-costa-blanca-1-local-b65-03760).
- [The report](../content/documents/health/March%202022%20eye%20report.pdf) was clear at that time although the ocular pressure is in the high range of normal.
- On 23rd April 2023, I went again for a check up. The report came back with [high ocular pressure](../content/documents/health/April%202023%20eye%20report.pdf).
- I was told I had high ocular pressure and needed to come in to have it monitored regularly as it could be a sign of sudden onset glaucoma which can cause blindness.
- I went in regularly until the I left for holidays and the pressure was always high. I went once in France too I believe.
- Alain Afflelou didn't note every check that I had but usually did.
- I was away from Denia until September 2023. When I got back, I went for an ocular pressure check again and the pressure was low again. They told me I didn't need to come back for monitoring anymore.
- Since then it's been difficult to think straight about anything and I failed to go for a check up again until November 2024.
- My eyes had been feeling pretty OK up until I spent a week back in my apartment in Denia at the end of October 2024 when I started to feel really unwell.
- Included in those unwell feelings was concerns about my eyes: burning sensation, blurred vision, headaches, shooting nerve pains around the face.
- I got a preliminary eye pressure check in Bangkok mid-November and was informed the pressure was high.
- Today, Thursday 28th November, I had a full analysis and checkup done at Rutnin Eye Hospital in Bangkok.
- Ocular pressure was not so high but I have been diagnosed, nonetheless, with Primary Angle Closure Suspect.

## Psychological effects

- My mind has been battered with NLP/MRA seduction techniques and porn symbolism since, at least, December 2022.
- This would probably have had only little effect if it hadn't been coupled with some kind of narcotic substance.
- I can't imagine how young girls deal with this. It must truly overwhelm them.
- Are they doing it to minors too? Well, why wouldn't they if they could? 
- The fact that been utterly obsessed with my child sexual abuse experience for nearly 10 years and have used the information I wrote in my statement to attempt to terrorize me has been enormously stressful as you can imagine.

### Work

- While I was being drugged it became impossible to deal with difficult situations at work.
- The anxiety I was feeling was so intense, I couldn't cope with it and had to leave two jobs.
- At the time, I thought it was because I had been suffering from anxiety and depression for a long while, but now I'm not so sure it was *all* my own original anxiety because it was intense in a way it had never been before at work.

### Negative

- My mind feels utterly polluted with porn and unhealthy sexual ideas. This is more so if I am feeling aroused. These thoughts are not my own. It's horrible.
- I don't know when it started but I was overwhelmed with the feeling I was going to have a child with the trumpet teacher. It was intense and inexplicable. I think they were "throwing the (NLP) book at me", at this stage, and I wonder how many women have been trapped into marriage by these manipulation techniques and, therefore, a lifelong connection with someone they were probably unsure of, at best.
- There was a lot of content that I'm sure was intended to make me feel insecure about how I looked. Content about fat women when I was putting on weight. Content about acne when I had some. Even content about a tiny wart on my nose. Lots and lots of content about the urinary problems I was having that I did a lot of online searches about. It was relentless.

### Positive

- Ironically, whatever NLP plus medication combo they were using on me healed me of anxiety and depression. 
- I thought what I was experiencing was true love, and it probably was a little bit, but the real trigger was the drugs and sexual feelings in the context of love that I hadn't experienced for twenty years.
- Another extremely positive effect of me going through all the NLP seduction techniques online in the context of sexual grooming of women and children is that I am able to describe it.
