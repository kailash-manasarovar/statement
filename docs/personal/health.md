## Homeopath

- The homeopath I saw in Denia from early 2023 to March 2024 was Ana Vilalba.
- In her notes, you will see I complained about the following symptoms over this time:
    - Stress and anxiety, PTSD issues primarily
    - Inflamed gums, teeth issues
    - Kidney issues
    - Urinary issues
    - Vomiting and sickness at home
    - Eye problems, burning sensation, feeling like I can't see properly
    - Tiredness
    - Absent mindedness, can't think straight
- Ana was over-interested in my sexual abuse history and asked me about it every visit, asking questions like, "where were your parents" etc. The questions were not loving or kind, and felt like she was trying to find a way to blame me for it.
- She gave me homeopathic drops which I took every day. Here are some of [my updates to her](../content/documents/emails/ana-homeopath-1.pdf).
- When I complained about my eyes, she suggested an eye mist company that she had an account with Quinton Medical, and I bought two or three eye mist products.
- Another thing she mentioned, every session, was domestic violence by giving an example of a patient who had finally found the strength to leave.
- When I left, I wrote her [this letter](../content/documents/emails/ana-homeopath-2.pdf) to which I received no reply.

## Hair narcotic test

- On the 5th November 2024, at AlphaBioLabs in London, I undertook the 12 month hair analysis for narcotics.
- The results came back negative.

## Heavy metal analysis

- On 11th November 2024, at Medex in Bangkok, I undertook the comprehensive heavy metal and toxicology blood tests.
- Everything came back normal.

## Kidneys

- Since December 2022, when the trumpet teacher began at the conservatory,  I have had trouble with my kidneys, particularly the right one.
- At Christmas 2022, I had a seizure of some sort in Samui on holiday and I went to A&E at Bangkok Hospital. They told me everything was fine, it was just panic, but nevertheless I had frothy urine for a few days after that.
- On 28th January, I got a mild form of rhabdo at chamber music class with the trumpet teacher.
- I suffered frothy urine and other ill effects after that for some time.
- I went on a strict kidney diet, lost a lot of weight (15kg) and the urine problem became intermittent.
- I went to my GP in Denia for a blood test to check for kidney failure markers. They did a blood test for everything and skipped the kidney function test. There was no explanation why.
- I went to the pharmacy in Denia to do a DIY creatinine test. They never had one available. It was not clear why.
- The frothy urine and pain in my kidney area always comes back hard if I'm unwell. So, for example, when I had Covid in May 2023, my kidneys were battered from it. This was also true when I had the serious chest infection from 13th March to 5th April where I even cracked a rib coughing. I also became unwell in August 2024 with a chest infection. During these times I had frothy urine and back pain all the time.
- My urine became frothy again whenever I was back in Denia living at Carrer Furs.
- On 12th November 2024, at Bangkok Hospital, I undertook the comprehensive kidney analysis tests.
- Everything was normal except for anion gap which was low.

- I continue to have daily pain in my kidney area but no froth in urine at the time of writing.

## Eyes

- On 17th March 2022, I went for a regular eye check up at [Alain Afflelou in Ondara](https://www.afflelou.es/opticas/ondara/afflelou-c-c-portal-de-la-marina-av-costa-blanca-1-local-b65-03760).
- [The report](../content/documents/health/March%202022%20eye%20report.pdf) was clear at that time although the ocular pressure is in the high range of normal.
- On 23rd April 2023, I went again for a check up. The report came back with [high ocular pressure](../content/documents/health/April%202023%20eye%20report.pdf).
- I was told I had high ocular pressure and needed to come in to have it monitored regularly as it could be a sign of sudden onset glaucoma which can cause blindness.
- I went in regularly until the I left for holidays and the pressure was always high. I went once in France too I believe.
- Alain Afflelou didn't note every check that I had but usually did.
- I was away from Denia until September 2023. When I got back, I went for an ocular pressure check again and the pressure was low again. They told me I didn't need to come back for monitoring anymore.
- Since then it's been difficult to think straight about anything and I failed to go for a check up again until November 2024.
- My eyes had been feeling pretty OK up until I spent a week back in my apartment in Denia at the end of October 2024 when I started to feel really unwell.
- Included in those unwell feelings was concerns about my eyes: burning sensation, blurred vision, headaches, shooting nerve pains around the face.
- I got a preliminary eye pressure check in Bangkok mid-November and was informed the pressure was high.
- Today, Thursday 28th November, I had a full analysis and checkup done at Rutnin Eye Hospital in Bangkok.
- Ocular pressure was not so high but I have been diagnosed, nonetheless, with Primary Angle Closure Suspect.

## Psychological effects

- My mind has been battered with NLP/MRA seduction techniques and porn symbolism since, at least, December 2022.
- This would probably have had only little effect if it hadn't been coupled with some kind of narcotic substance.
- I can't imagine how young girls deal with this. It must truly overwhelm them.
- Are they doing it to minors too? Well, why wouldn't they if they could? 
- The fact that been utterly obsessed with my child sexual abuse experience for nearly 10 years and have used the information I wrote in my statement to attempt to terrorize me has been enormously stressful as you can imagine.

### Cognitive loss

- I believe I have lost my previous level of cognitive skills to a large degree and I can only assume this is due to being poisoned over time in my apartment.
- I mentioned in my description of [March's traumatic events](../timeline/2024/march.md#changing-card-pin-numbers) that I had great difficulty performing simple tasks.
- In fact, I have noticed my writing skills declining over the last year. It used to be extremely simple for me to prepare and execute writing tasks, now it isn't. 
- I believe this makes it highly unlikely for me to continue working in the way I was before as things are now difficult.
- I have also completely lost my ability to play chess well. I used to be extremely good at chess, and quick to understand the board and game status, and I always beat average players. I was always able to see the permutations of about 5 or 6 moves in advance.
- Even when addicted to valium in 2018, I beat the men in the tech department during a chess tournament we set up at Goldman Sachs, much to their annoyance.
- I subscribed to Chess.com in August and I couldn't quite believe how useless I am at chess. I'm below average now, if that, and I make ridiculous mistakes constantly.
- I think this must be more proof of poisoning; methanol is my guess.

### Work

- While I was being drugged it became impossible to deal with difficult situations at work.
- The anxiety I was feeling was so intense, I couldn't cope with it and had to leave two jobs.
- At the time, I thought it was because I had been suffering from anxiety and depression for a long while, but now I'm not so sure it was *all* my own original anxiety because it was intense in a way it had never been before at work.

### Negative

- My mind feels utterly polluted with porn and unhealthy sexual ideas. This is more so if I am feeling aroused which thankfully I don't if I am not in flat in Denia. 
- These thoughts are not my own. It's horrible.
- I don't know when it started but I was overwhelmed with the feeling I was going to have a child with the trumpet teacher. It was intense and inexplicable. I think they were "throwing the (NLP/hypnosis/online seduction) book at me", at this stage, and I wonder how many women have been trapped into marriage by these manipulation techniques and, therefore, a lifelong connection with someone they were probably unsure of, at best.
- There was a lot of content that I'm sure was intended to make me feel insecure about how I looked. Content about fat women when I was putting on weight. Content about acne when I had some. Even content about a tiny wart on my nose. Lots and lots of content about the urinary problems I was having that I did a lot of online searches about. It was relentless.

### Positive

- Ironically, whatever NLP plus medication combo they were using on me that made me fall in love healed me completely of anxiety and depression. 
- I wonder if I was on an informal drug trial.
- I thought what I was experiencing was true love, and it probably was a little bit, but the real trigger was the drugs and sexual feelings in the context of love that I hadn't experienced for twenty years.
- Another extremely positive effect of me enduring these NLP seduction techniques online in the context of sexual grooming of women and children is that I am now able to describe it.
