oh I&amp;#39;m Katherine Margaret Murphy I stood
as a candidate for the party of women in
Finley and Goldis Green in July the
general election in the UK it was

probably one of the most amazing
experiences of my life it opened doors I
didn&amp;#39;t even know existed
I I&amp;#39;m absolutely
hooked doing it again or you know just

just being that voice that needs to be
there or part of the voices that need to
be there to bring all these horrendous
things that are going on to attention to
the general public I agree I had a wheel

of a time I I didn&amp;#39;t expect what
happened to happen it was really intense
but I really enjoyed myself and I um
yeah I&amp;#39;m looking forward to doing it
again as well yeah well you actually

live in Spain don&amp;#39;t you yeah I live in a
place called denya it&amp;#39;s near Alti and
near Valencia it&amp;#39;s on the sea beside the
SE it&amp;#39;s very beautiful very lovely I I
I&amp;#39;ve been living here on and off since

2006 when I was doing my PhD here in
Spain and I love the environment the
culture the people
yeah and that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m here keep
Blissful and you&amp;#39;ve got the

weather yeah the weather&amp;#39;s pretty good
yeah complaining about the weather yeah
so do you want to tell us a bit more
about your election campaign why you got
involved yeah so I me I I&amp;#39;ve just been

sort of frustrated with not having any
kind of Avenue or way to express my
political views over the last years and
you know the parties that I might have
voted for in the past are just their

their positions on transing children and
women&amp;#39;s rights the erosion of women&amp;#39;s
rights are just sort of appalling to me
and so of of course I found myself
politically homeless and I remember

tweeting about two years ago why doesn&amp;#39;t
anyone I wish someone would start a
party for the
San and then Kelly Jay starts the party
year was it in February February yeah

yeah I think it took quite a long time
to register but in February it went live
yet where and I joined immediately
obviously it was like a dream come true
add as well yeah and I&amp;#39;d been already a

member of Le in speak for years and for
a good while and so I joined
immediately and then when the snap
election came up an email went around I
think it was mid

June on early tune and said why don&amp;#39;t
you
stand no why yeah why not let me stand
and so everything kind of
serendipitously arranged itself in my

life for that to happen as well which
was quite extraordinary and so I took
two weeks off work and run an election
campaign I had all these volunteers that
just sort of appeared out of nowhere so

help me we went to the tube stations and
we gave out leaflet and went to hustings
I didn&amp;#39;t speak at hustings because I&amp;#39;m I
wasn&amp;#39;t ready for that to be honest next
time yeah course so you were you like in

the panel on the hust as a c no I was
right okay there was only one hustings
in the constituency that I was aware of
and it was at the synagogue in gold as
green and I hadn&amp;#39;t been invited but I

was okay with that because as I said I
was just not going to be I was just
going to be be a disaster really because
I didn&amp;#39;t know anything about what
happens or and you know yeah so my hust

the the main hust that I attended it was
the first hust I&amp;#39;d ever been
to I was there with the MP from my local
area who&amp;#39;s been MP for years since 1997
and Blair got into Power um and all

these other candidates who I didn&amp;#39;t
really know as well um and yeah it just
I got up on that microphone and just
power came out I was just yeah I I
really enjoyed that actually but I&amp;#39;m not

sure if I would do another hust just
because of the audience like the reform
candidate who are probably the closest
thing that we&amp;#39;ve got to what yeah
they&amp;#39;re the only party who talk about

gender but I don&amp;#39;t think they get it but
they&amp;#39;re the closest
ones they didn&amp;#39;t attend and I can see
why it was basically Lea&amp;#39;s following who
were there I think yeah so I&amp;#39;m not sure

if I would go back not sure or you have
to think about it but it it was it was
glorious because one of them actually
said that reform were far right and I
was like can&amp;#39;t let that go so when it

was my turn to answer the question I
can&amp;#39;t even remember what the question
was and I just stood up and said
Somebody&amp;#39;s just called reform far right
you know they call women far right and

Nazis for saying that want our rights
yeah it&amp;#39;s just to shut people up and I
think I caused a bit of a stir so
unfortunately nobody recorded it because
that would have been an internet

Sensation that would have been brilliant
though that&amp;#39;s exactly what we need isn&amp;#39;t
it yeah and
few so I think if you you had the
opportunity you would be able to do it

cuz you know all your stuff you know
what&amp;#39;s happening yeah it&amp;#39;s just a m
matter of you know doing it I
guess it&amp;#39;s amazing how it just comes to
you I I think I was quite lucky because

I never got to go first so I had time to
think about the answers while other
candidates were answering and obviously
what they said helped me to think about
how I could answer so that that was good

yeah I wondered if it wasn&amp;#39;t because we
have been tarnished as as far right the
the synagogue didn&amp;#39;t invite me I did
wonder if that was kind of one of the
reasons and I guess it you know that&amp;#39;s

kind of a like if people believe that
lie then then you know you are we are
going to be blocked from speaking which
is I I suppose exactly what they
want people to believe that we&amp;#39;re far

right it&amp;#39;s just Madness but then by
blocking what we&amp;#39;re seeing then how can
they find out what we&amp;#39;re about and how
do they learn any other perspective like
yeah well but that&amp;#39;s what they want

isn&amp;#39;t it don&amp;#39;t want that&amp;#39;s exactly what
they&amp;#39;re they want they want us to be
silent they want to silence women I mean
they the sameish All Around The World
Isn&amp;#39;t it keep women

Qui yeah it&amp;#39;s horrendous what&amp;#39;s
happening in
Afghanistan they&amp;#39;re not even allowed to
talk to each other now I I haven&amp;#39;t dared
to look into actually the details of

that I can&amp;#39;t bear to it&amp;#39;s horrible isn&amp;#39;t
it watch that&amp;#39;s where hatred go when
hatred isn&amp;#39;t you know over H held
back that&amp;#39;s where it goes it&amp;#39;s the H
Maids tail isn&amp;#39;t it it&amp;#39;s Sinister and

it&amp;#39;s
reing I am genuinely worried about like
I know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s horrendous what happens
in other places but and but to think
that that might happen here as well in a

country that
was like Democratic and I
know it&amp;#39;s like the foundation of free
speech in this country it&amp;#39;s based on
Democracy is based on free speech and

they&amp;#39;re trying to silence it and it&amp;#39;s
absolutely Sinister it really is it
really is extremely Sinister and it&amp;#39;s
all based in misog hatred of women so
it&amp;#39;s all insane

fundamentally yeah no reason to hate
another type of human so what was there
a a moment where you thought hang on a
minute this is really this trans stuff
is really bad for women yes yeah I&amp;#39;ll

tell you how I got into the trans thing
because that&amp;#39;s quite interesting I am a
sexual abuse Survivor a child sexual
abuse Survivor I&amp;#39;m a grooming gang
Survivor I was targeted

sedated drad and rates repeatedly where
I was
16 and I had a massive
PTSD reaction to that everyone knew
because everyone always knows nobody

speaks nobody protected me nobody helped
me in fact I was I&amp;#39;m I was sort of the
Pariah you know everyone kind
of enjoyed hating me for for what had
happened to me so kind of like the scap

goat yeah I think it just very difficult
for people to accept how men are they
prefer to you
know agree with them and blame the woman
blame the victim somehow or pretend it

hasn&amp;#39;t happened pretend it hasn&amp;#39;t
happened you&amp;#39;re making up it&amp;#39;s all in
your in your mind whatever the thing is
it was all in my mind because I&amp;#39;d been
sedated so I had no memories of what

happened had some small memory of of
what happened that were clearly criminal
which I you know were very very clear
but that led into you know really really
horrenda Brut brutal stuff that I had no

memory of so I&amp;#39;ve spent 30 years of my
life with this kind of
fear and every step of my every step I
took in the world was fear I was just
you know my whole body was just waiting

for something to happen all the time and
so it was they took my life from me
basically and yeah after that I I must
have some kind of inner strength because
I managed to sort

of
suppress what was coming
up to the point where I could kind of
half managed normal life so I went to
University and I drank a lot and drugs

and like that a lot of
escapism I wasn&amp;#39;t able to have normal
relationships with anyone work it was
always impossible because I had to be
around men or T I chose the career which

is I&amp;#39;m always the only woman which is
kind of strange but there you go and
anyway so yeah so that&amp;#39;s the backdrop
and then I&amp;#39;ve been healing obviously
from that and I started to realize

something was very wrong and I got
physically ill digestive problems you
know really you know debilitating stuff
and I realized at some point that all it
was all connected to

these things that had happened to me
that I hadn&amp;#39;t addressed or hadn&amp;#39;t faced
was hiding from basically so I started
to heal to find therapist trying to
access those memories which I did I went

to the place twice the first I I had a
very cathartic kind of explosive memory
come back in 2006 and I went to the
police
immediately and they didn&amp;#39;t take me

seriously in fact the detective he was
very nice but he kept he had a g i i was
videoed he did a video interview which
took about half an hour and he had a a
woman police officer doing doing the

editing and managing the video and he
kept he kept saying the most outrageous
sexist jokes to him like oh you should
really be in the kitchen shouldn&amp;#39;t you
you know it was just in congruous like

here I am reporting child sexual abuse
from grooming gang I said he&amp;#39;s saying I
mean it was just nuts anyway it was so
difficult and I became
because it was such a big story you know

I went with this one incident or two
incidents the one the one that I&amp;#39;d
always remembered and the one that I had
remembered during therapy the big one
and there was all sorts of things going

on around it like you know all these
different people
involved and I hadn&amp;#39;t remembered any of
that so I had 10 years to kind
of put that all together and I went back

to the police and I went back to the
police at that time when
it was safe to there was a a few years
of of being treated with really enormous
respect

and you know it was just after
savle big cases and so they changed sort
of everything that had happened I could
remember I went back to police and they
took me seriously and they believed me

and I dealt with two women police
officers who were just
incredible and they arrested the guy and
everything and they were doing a proper
investigation and it was just so

catic and then the CPS Cham charging
criteria and they dropped the
case goodness how did that I I just went
into you I went into a massive suicidal
depression for about eight years was

anxious crazy just this anxiety was just
just
intolerable and so I continue started to
with my healing practice and what I was
Finding is that every time I found a

therapist I ended up having to help them
deal with my story because it too
difficult that is not what therapy is
supposed to look like I know but I was
it was for me it was a lottery I was

finding people that just didn&amp;#39;t have
that kind of space to hold what gone on
for me yeah and why and what I was
realizing was a lot of the therapists I
was I had seen would kind of just hobby

is really or you know they hadn&amp;#39;t been
on the front
line and I thought okay so I&amp;#39;m going to
go on the front line because you know I
want to help people eventually because

this I&amp;#39;m not this whole life life of
mine can&amp;#39;t be for nothing so you know
I&amp;#39;ve always the aim is to help people
other people always and so I join
childline of the

counselor perfect and that&amp;#39;s where I
found out about
TRS right
okay because I it had been in the
periphery people were talking about it

like I think I join maybe joined the
women&amp;#39;s equality party as well at the
time because I was really yeah I can&amp;#39;t
remember it very well the but probably I
did cuz I remembered it being a thing

and I remember just not being not having
the space to deal with that at that time
cuz I was just sort of immersed in this
depression and anxiety and this need to
deal with the violence against women and

so it seemed like it was different it
was the same as what I was dealing with
I didn&amp;#39;t realize actually it&amp;#39;s kind of
fundament mentally the same so child
line was an eye opener really completely

because they were we were basically
forced to affirm these
kids who were
suffering
enormously that&amp;#39;s not what counseling is

counseling&amp;#39;s where you gently
challenge the point of reference of
someone&amp;#39;s um view in order to help them
to see it from different perspectives so
that they can reframe what&amp;#39;s happened to

them yeah and I would write because that
it was emails so I would write with that
in mind and be gently kind of reflecting
what they&amp;#39;d said and maybe saying you
know you know

just things that were pulled out in by
moderators and I was asked to change
like there was one example there was
this girl who had been identifying as a
boy and had changed her name to

whatever and I got the email where she&amp;#39;s
had a chat with her
parents
and decided that she&amp;#39;s actually a
girl great brilliant yeah and but that

was the day that in the system there
were all these red warnings all over the
the dashboard saying make sure you don&amp;#39;t
misgender anyone blah blah blah and it
was really weird and I was like well

that&amp;#39;s great because you know this was
my reply that&amp;#39;s great cuz you know
things change and labels are just labels
and one you know blah blah blah and it&amp;#39;s
great to hear you had this conversation

with your parents and blah blah blah and
it was really you know very
positive and I got the moderator
saying you have to call her by
her boy name I I I said no no I&amp;#39;m not

doing that and we had sort of online
fisty cuffs about it and there was just
no way I was doing that I said you can&amp;#39;t
do that she&amp;#39;s just
said that she&amp;#39;s a girl and now you want

to confuse her even more by using the
name that she&amp;#39;s and it was stuff like
this and having to sign post to mermaids
for breast binders and things like this
and I just

I just couldn&amp;#39;t believe it
really and so I had to leave because
obviously it was just it for me really
so did you get a lot of training to be
able to deal with all this stuff that

sounds quite heavy like the children
they&amp;#39;re under 18 and they&amp;#39;re using
volunteers to work with vulnerable
children on by email which I wouldn&amp;#39;t
like as a counselor myself I wouldn&amp;#39;t

want to to use email I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s
a good a good way of doing
it yeah so we did have training and we
were always monitored by actual
counselor so they would kind of you know

any any reply you made was always double
checked
always they were all trans activists
anyway so you know didn&amp;#39;t make any
difference yeah I mean for me actually

this it was just week after week of
suicidal children really self Haring and
they were mostly
girls and actually I felt like I was
doing a good job I really did and I felt

like a lot of us were and it wasn&amp;#39;t all
and I think they figured out pretty
early on I wasn&amp;#39;t really going to be
having
anything with this

trans can I say a rude word on this
podast of course you can
B I&amp;#39;m using that word a lot lately
actually and yeah so they would
obviously give me different types of

emails to deal with and I never really
had many of those because I&amp;#39;d argue
about them the half but the ones I were
was having were just so the I mean the
kids are just in an absolute State

really at the moment and it&amp;#39;s the girls
was like nine out of 10 were girls
and the the issues that girls have were
not the same as what boys had like girls
were having really really big big

problems and the boys just weren&amp;#39;t
having them in the same way you might
get the odd boy that would write about
how he&amp;#39;d been violent and that was kind
of such a sort of breath of fresh air

that actually someone would be writing
in and and recognizing that their
behavior
was wasn&amp;#39;t helping then as a boy and I
and I thought that&amp;#39;s brilliant so there

was a few of them there was this one
girl who was I think she was 13 and she
had tried to commit suicide about three
times already she was suicidal again and
I was looking in the noes and she&amp;#39;d

phoned up because they would check the
nodes as well because they can phone or
text
or email and she owned up in the first
thing or or texted and the first thing

they&amp;#39; said was what are your what are
your
pronouns everywhere isn&amp;#39;t it but you
know if you&amp;#39;re a
suicidal

13-year-old and you ask for help and the
very first thing you hear is cult
language then the cult is your
friend yeah I I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it it&amp;#39;s
was just

unbelievable so that&amp;#39;s when I started to
find out and I went on Twitter during
that time and I just
started to kind
of be more and more horrified every day

yes so what how how long ago was that I
was 2021 I went on Twitter I was I was
at Char about two two and a half years
hell I went on Twitter about 2021 and I
was keeping a very low profile very

Anonymous and just like Jo on the floor
every day with what&amp;#39;s been going
on and yeah I mean people don&amp;#39;t believe
you and you tell them what&amp;#39;s happening
because it&amp;#39;s so outrageous like

I you just can&amp;#39;t believe it can you I
know so it&amp;#39;s been like that really then
has poit politicized me which is good
uhuh
so like did you find out like CU that&amp;#39;s

what happened to me like I found out
what was
I actually saw a video of Kelly J viral
where she was saying she&amp;#39; had the police
at her door for being UNT about

pedophiles and then I was trying to find
out what it was about because I started
being interested I realized there was a
problem but everything that she was
talking about was quite topical so it

didn&amp;#39;t make sense to me because I didn&amp;#39;t
have any context right and then one of
my friends said oh she&amp;#39;s coming at
Newcastle do you want to come and then I
heard from the women their experiences

and I was like oh my
goodness and then I started really
learning what was going
on was it the same for you like on
Twitter is that where you found out what

was happening yeah so I found out about
Kelly Jay on
Twitter she was banned on Twitter when I
joined as well so I can&amp;#39;t I must have
found out through you know like word of

mouth or whatever and then I went to let
women speak
in August
2022 or end of July
2022 and I was still in a very kind of

suicidal depression actually and
couldn&amp;#39;t speak to people wasn&amp;#39;t really
able to communicate very well was very
scared about being found out and so I
was call hat

glasses being found out what just
because you didn&amp;#39;t share the cult View
or yeah just I was worried about losing
my job or you know being targeted by
trans activist I couldn&amp;#39;t have dealt

with any of that at that time I was
really wounded and
just you know so side all I all I could
think about was not how how I was going
to not be here

anymore and I felt like that for years
so you know
but I&amp;#39;m not like I don&amp;#39;t feel like that
at all completely heal from that now by
the way I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re ever

completely healed but I&amp;#39;m glad to hear
you in a better place that&amp;#39;s good well I
I have not had a thought like that since
I don&amp;#39;t know when okay so I do feel like
it&amp;#39;s just completely gone yeah yeah it&amp;#39;s

incredible it&amp;#39;s kind of
miraculous that&amp;#39;s good me as well the
anxiety there are stories about why that
might be the case but I won&amp;#39;t hear but
yeah I&amp;#39;ve like the anxiety I had was so

bad I couldn&amp;#39;t actually leave the house
so I got horribly addicted to valian
right I have IED up in
rehab I couldn&amp;#39;t go out of the house
without without medicating myself I

couldn&amp;#39;t go to work without medicating
myself the anxiety was so bad I know
yeah ended uping rehab and so I was just
in this kind of anxious and IR asdal
depression state for

ages and then I started to be targeted
here by the porn Gales and that&amp;#39;s when I
started to get better I found this kind
of I found this community strength
inside really ironic the thing that you

were really worried about happening when
it happened it gave you strength yeah
the fight like this Warrior inside
just emerged yeah they they&amp;#39;ve been
drugging they&amp;#39;d been drugging me as well

without my knowledge I don&amp;#39;t know how
exactly but probably something like in
the nare called you know they can just
very easily drug people and sedate
people these days there&amp;#39;s so many

different ways to do it and I was out of
my
mind and they got access to my computer
and my phones and they checked my
movements and they took very sensitive

videos of me in in
sexual situations they sent the were on
the
town mess I know it&amp;#39;s crazy and so
actually so the second time I went to

let wom feet was in Madrid and I told
the story it&amp;#39;s actually on the it&amp;#39;s on
YouTube there because that was happening
at that time and they were actually
drugging me at that time as well I was

out of my mind it&amp;#39;s stopped now so it&amp;#39;s
like
yeah it stopped now I&amp;#39;m yeah I&amp;#39;m still
fighting it&amp;#39;s really strange situation
but anyway yeah yeah so like that that

poorness at the bottom of a lot of harms
and
Society yeah I think the men just lose
their minds actually and they&amp;#39;re groomed
into it by other men their big brothers

who were groomed into it by their big
brothers and they all think it&amp;#39;s
completely
normal because it&amp;#39;s so
prevalent and nobody&amp;#39;s questioning it

nobody
nobody&amp;#39;s saying you know are you sure
this is all right nobody&amp;#39;s making those
statements well we are we are yeah we
are this I mean the society here I live

in people have just do whatever the men
tell them to do there&amp;#39;s no there&amp;#39;s no
way you can even
you can&amp;#39;t change anything here unless
something outrageous or miraculous

happens everyone&amp;#39;s kind
of completely
behaved and does whatever they say and I
think that&amp;#39;s been true forever and
probably it it worked more or less up

until porn became a
thing because porn has
made violence against sexual violence
against
women completely

normal being PA&amp;#39;s being around for
forever but I think it&amp;#39;s more that it&amp;#39;s
like online and it and people have
smartphones so they have access at any
time of the day or night yeah with this

little device that they keep in their
back pocket or wherever they keep it
yeah so where there might have been one
one in 100 looking at that stuff now
that it&amp;#39;s 95 out of 100 people looking

at that stuff on a regular
basis it&amp;#39;s like mind poison
yeah yeah so yeah so I went to let women
speak in Madrid it was actually this
this April and I told my story in

Spanish which matches the story of my of
sexual abuse when I was 16 in in the
most kind of extraordinary way it&amp;#39;s like
a
reenactment which would be the

therapeutic
definition curious because becoming
healed of anxiety and depression related
to sexual abuse at at that moment like
this reenactment begins it&amp;#39;s so curious

it&amp;#39;s such a curious thing and
anyway yeah so that it was just not even
six months ago
really yeah I remember that the Madrid
let women speak was on YouTube but

obviously I don&amp;#39;t speak Spanish so I
found it really difficult I need to go
back cuz I think I was trying to watch
it live and I didn&amp;#39;t obviously
understand any of what the women were

saying so think I need to go back and
see if I can put some subtitles on well
I did mine in English as well did you I
said it in Spanish and English it was
very short I wrote it out and I I had

some help with the Spanish and I think
the Spanish is weird the Spanish ended
up being better than the English cuz
when I had to switch back into English I
didn&amp;#39;t know what I was

saying and so my English c will probably
it&amp;#39;s a bit sort of I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s not
it doesn&amp;#39;t flow really because I I
couldn&amp;#39;t translate back I was looking at
the Spanish and I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out

how
to so do you speak Spanish well you must
do living over there well no I wouldn&amp;#39;t
say well
well enough yeah I if I practiced it

would be pretty good probably I don&amp;#39;t
have a I I never practice yeah I don&amp;#39;t
speak I&amp;#39;m very isolated here I don&amp;#39;t
speak to people very much but if I did
practice I&amp;#39;d get pretty good quite

quickly I was much better before like
when I was here in 2014 15 yeah I was
pretty
good not brilliant still but pass the p
I didn&amp;#39;t identify as a Spanish person I

didn&amp;#39;t
par oh dear you&amp;#39;ve got to laugh at it
haven&amp;#39;t you it would make you cry
absolutely do I tell you about
yeah it&amp;#39;s quite interesting so I guess

this is what I was worried about and why
I was Anonymous the whole time and so
now I&amp;#39;m not
Anonymous it happened everything I
expected to happen did happen it&amp;#39;s quite

interesting so I worked for a company
big crypto
Giant and I started last
November and I was employed in a small
team and there was this guy on the team

who was really really strange he was
very
erratic and very offensive and Loud Mo
and just like a very curious character
and he was identifying probably as a

cryptographer and a mathematician and
engineer and he&amp;#39;d been hired as in the
engineering team initially and he&amp;#39;
lasted one week and they threw him out
because he was

just he was impossible to work with he
was rude loud he was he was sort of like
a troublemaker like a Aon provocator you
know just always causing trouble
and uh anyway he was like always going

on about how he was this and how he was
a security expert and blah blah blah and
I had just found out about two months
previously that I I was being
hacked because the hackers revealed

themselves to
me and made it very clear that they had
access to all
my laptops phones everything so that was
like pretty new to me me and I couldn&amp;#39;t

figure out how they were doing
it um and so I talked to this guy about
it because at that moment we were still
we would we would sort of work CHS right
so yeah there was no animosity between

us at all in fact he had employed me he&amp;#39;
interviewed me and said that yes
Catherine should have the job and so we
had a good relationship as far as he
could with someone like that

and I said I asked for help I said so
they I I&amp;#39;m being hacked I don&amp;#39;t know how
they&amp;#39;ve got in but they have access to
Twitter and they have access to my to
YouTube they seem to be able to to

post posts directly you know in my
browser that are aimed for me that no
one else would be seeing I don&amp;#39;t know
how it&amp;#39;s happening can you help
me cuz he&amp;#39;s a security expert and every

every line he says is up as a security
expert
I and he said well give me your Twitter
address so I
did of course my twit address is my

women&amp;#39;s rights activism addressed and
you
know transphobic
matous whatever that means and
so and I don&amp;#39;t know why I do it actually

but I I just did and I gave it to him
and I knew the ramifications and what
could happen I just did but and from
that moment everything changed for me in
the company everything changed for me in

fact he ended up getting fired for
bullying me about two weeks
later okay he started to bully me
immediately it was and he was such an
outspoken rude person anyway for him to

start bullying was you know quite
extreme
and I just thought this guy there&amp;#39;s
something up with this guy so I did a
Google search on him and it turned out

he was an actor anyway an
actor but why why would he get a job in
there but I was thinking was he like a
spy from one of the one of the
competitors it I mean there&amp;#39;s so much

money to be made in crypto that it&amp;#39;s
just crazy it&amp;#39;s like the wild west and
so he was an actor
make sense yeah I don&amp;#39;t even know if he
he was just sort of bluffing his way

but you know sexism works both ways
doesn&amp;#39;t it it was really interesting
because everybody believed him and just
because of how he looked and and how he
spoke and he looked like a nerd and so

everyone believed he was you to be
listened to and
respected and he was an actor it&amp;#39;s
really interesting and he I think he
he&amp;#39;d been moved into artic team and we

were the technical writing team and he
couldn&amp;#39;t do any damage there really so I
think he probably wanted out anyway and
he started bullying me really badly and
he got fired for

it well that&amp;#39;s
positive they couldn&amp;#39;t not fire him it
was so outrageous and in the meantime
he&amp;#39;s told everyone about me and you know
what I stand for on Twitter and you know

my personal beliefs and I I was just
targeted from then on and yeah most
outrageously everybody company or was it
particular
people um there was one guy who&amp;#39;s quite

high up and he&amp;#39;s got a big kind of lead
position and it was all his
teams you know like whole groups of
people I&amp;#39;m sure he was instructing them
and I had to work with him very closely

anyway and so in from about January he
stopped giving me
work right
he do are like full-time employment or
was it sporadic or for me yeah no it was

a full-time job yeah but you just
stopped giving you work that&amp;#39;s not very
cost effective for the for the company
as
it yeah but I had I had work all all

over the place and he was one specific
product okay so you had work from other
places yeah and they like and then they
fired 20% of the workforce and I got
moved up to the lead of the team so I

was managing this team a small
team so it didn&amp;#39;t really matter that he
wasn&amp;#39;t giving me work because I had all
this other stuff to do anyway but I I
did note it it was noted and at the same

time he started to complain about me as
if I was
incompetent he would sort of say oh you
know you I don&amp;#39;t like it he he didn&amp;#39;t
come out and say it like

definitively but he had to make up
some reason why he didn&amp;#39;t want me to
write anything I&amp;#39;ve been a writer for
professional writer for years and years
and years as a technical writer and he

just dismissed everything I said and did
as an expert as has not being you know
so it was like that really and then
being so I was the lead of the
team and all his team his other

teams announced they wanted to help me
so we had this big meeting there was
about I don&amp;#39;t think 15 of them and me we
want to help you with the
documentation I was like great because I

had this team that were doing absolutely
they were just lazy bastards but I
wasn&amp;#39;t able to to get them to Buck Up
they just ignored me anyway so this this
bunch of people just came in and like

took
over like a military coup it was like a
military coup I said great I need the
help I need this this this and this it
just totally ignored me kind of doing

this over here and this over here and
you know completely undermining
obviously from
instruction it was like that so it&amp;#39;s it
was just constant constant I went to

offsite in barley with them in May
people were coming up to me all week
going oh I hear you&amp;#39;re
leaving this this guy threatened do
something very threatening over dinner

which was it was a threat of sexual
violence over dinner it was horrible so
there&amp;#39;s a few of us sitting around at
dinner this guy has started in the
company that week he&amp;#39;s completely new so

and there&amp;#39;s other people at the table
and he&amp;#39;s just staring at me and he&amp;#39;s got
his napkin
let&amp;#39;s see if I got
napkin it&amp;#39;s bigger than W and he&amp;#39;s

pisting it off going like this tying it
around his neck tying it around his neck
like a noose going like there fisting it
up slapping it on the
table C over and over and over he just

was unbelievable so I to play the next
morning about him cuz he seemed like a
dangerous man that was the last I heard
of that but I guess that was part of it
as well he was someone they couldn&amp;#39;t

fire as well right so he could do
whatever he like it was just like that
it just went on and on constantly M so
what happened in the end then well as
well as that my team mut need they

refused to do anything I said apart from
not knowing the job because in web 3 in
crypto everyone seems to think writers
are just admin everyone can do it and so
you get these people that can&amp;#39;t write

you know doing jobs for any need to know
all these different things and they just
don&amp;#39;t know them so I started to
implement all these kind of functions
and processes for editorial workflows

and Publishing workflows and technical
writing and they didn&amp;#39;t know they hadn&amp;#39;t
a clue about any of it and so they just
resisted they just wouldn&amp;#39;t do
anything but as well as that I think

they were getting instructions from the
the general tone of Katherine&amp;#39;s a
transfer we hate her we want her e and
one of my team started to be just
extraordinarily aggressive in meetings

shout me
down make up things that I&amp;#39;d said
complain to my boss that I&amp;#39;d said things
I never said you know it got so bad he
he just literally wouldn&amp;#39;t

communicate without
being enraged right and I complained
again and again to my boss and they just
ignored me basically and it got so bad I
had to stop team

meetings and uh he did it in one to ones
as well so I had to stop one to ones
nobody helped me from above they were
just expecting me to leave really and so
I&amp;#39;m stubborn and refused to

leave
and yeah and it just went on like this
and so the guy the original guy that
took the work away I had to step down
from my job as Lee because I it was just

unbelievable I mean you know so I slept
down and the guy the original guy that
was taking my work away comes in as lead
and of course he just stops ging me any
work at all and he gives all the work to

the to the guys that I&amp;#39;ve been saying
can&amp;#39;t do it and won&amp;#39;t do it and yeah so
that was the most recent so I decided it
was time to complain about the
harassment okay to the come which I did

about 3 weeks ago I spoke to the head of
legal I said I want to start harassment
procedures and i&amp;#39; I&amp;#39;ve sat these
training courses for the like like 100
time so I was like I want to start what

that you know what that process is so
you process because of the training that
You&amp;#39; done yeah yeah cuz I knew it was I
knew what was
available and so that was happening and

then they fired me know Friday and they
fired
me they said the whole team is
redundant so which is pretty weird
because they wrote they wrote the

reasons that they fired me was because
Tech writers do all these very specific
things and listed all the very specific
things that I do that I&amp;#39;m skilled to do
that no one else is skilled to do who

isn&amp;#39;t prot Riser and then they said but
we&amp;#39;re going to get someone else to we&amp;#39;re
going to get other people to do it so
we&amp;#39;ve decided you&amp;#39;re not
needed but was it a redundancy then to

the do a
consultation no
consultation no because it&amp;#39;s a Spanish
contract so it&amp;#39;s Spanish so it&amp;#39;s
different from here yeah yeah see if you

want major under under our law anyway I
don&amp;#39;t know about other laws you they
need to do a consultation and you get to
suggest
Alternatives and things like that but

obviously it&amp;#39;s different over there it
is different and I&amp;#39;m not sure how but I
think I I&amp;#39;m going to talk to a lawyer
about un unlawful dismissal because it
seems very unlawful to be yeah I would

have thought that it would be similar
like our laws would be similar because
of the EU but I don&amp;#39;t know so I wouldn&amp;#39;t
like to see probably yeah yeah once it&amp;#39;s
so it&amp;#39;s quite new so yeah refed a lawyer

now have you got plans for what you&amp;#39;re
going to do
next new job or you just enjoining your
time
off well but we can to do now I&amp;#39;ve been

on Twitter the last
three days like
just constantly it&amp;#39;s a bit of an
addiction actually yeah I know I&amp;#39;ve
already had people contacting me about

jobs so I&amp;#39;m kind of like no go away
I I want to rest for a
bit so I&amp;#39;m going I&amp;#39;m actually going to
Thailand for two months next week
because mainly because here has been so

I mean I I feel like I&amp;#39;m in danger here
I can&amp;#39;t I have to to the post office
today and I&amp;#39;m terrified I&amp;#39;m going to
wear have to wear my camera and it&amp;#39;s
just been horrendous to I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m like the

person everybody hates they lied about
me to the whole town basically I
complained that some of the teachers at
the local Conservatory were behaving
inappropriately with the girls and

seizing them I complained very
unofficially but you&amp;#39;re not allowed to
do that here
and so I was targeted
massively horrendously I mean like they

probably were hoping I&amp;#39;d kill myself
type thing really badly that sounds very
extreme it really has been
extraordinarily extreme they they
tracked me on my

mobile they had police stopped me in my
car that I there&amp;#39;s just a million things
I could tell you that they&amp;#39;ve done and
it&amp;#39;s been going on for about it&amp;#39;s been
going on for over two years they drugged

me I was studying piano at the
conservatory I went to class they
drugged me I don&amp;#39;t know what with but
some kind of aphrodisia type substance
they overdosed me I got rabdo they

probably gave me kidney damage rapo it&amp;#39;s
called rapto
Milo not sure that a kind of drug I&amp;#39;ve
never heard of that that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s when
you are poisoned your your muscles can&amp;#39;t

deal with the poison and they start
producing poison themselves and you that
can kill you you can also get rabo from
overexertion so when you overexert your
muscles and they can&amp;#39;t they can&amp;#39;t deal

with the toxins that your body&amp;#39;s
creating and they kind of poison you and
you can die you can get it in car
crashes as well things like that it&amp;#39;s a
really it&amp;#39;s something people just don&amp;#39;t

get unless you there&amp;#39;s some
extraordinary thing has and I got it
after my music class at the conservatory
Daniel okay have you got some support
about this no I&amp;#39;m ConEd about you please

not interested police here told me to go
away told me to get a a civil lawyer to
deal with it I went to the pce in Madrid
I&amp;#39;ve gotten a dener out with them in
Madrid about it but you know you think

if you&amp;#39;re raising concerns about
children&amp;#39;s safety people would kind of
spring into action and it&amp;#39;s just not
happened and in fact what&amp;#39;s happened is
that I&amp;#39;ve become the Pariah and the

Target and there&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;ve done
or said that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s Justified the
whole
town hating me and whatever they&amp;#39;ve told
them is lies because I actually love it

here and I love the people here and I
was studying with the kids and they were
my classmates and so I really I give a
 about them you know I really care
about them and I don&amp;#39;t want anything

anything like what happened to me to
happen to anyone else and it seems like
that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on here so I&amp;#39;m
really stubborn and haven&amp;#39;t left they
wanted me to leave they created this

enormous sort
of story it was like
a unbelievable they all took Parts they
created this situation where I was to
fall in love with this man and then he

would go out with the other woman and it
was all bollocks it was all lies but it
was they were just I were just insane
the psychop past anyway they created
this story and then to shame me and I

was supposed to be shamed and humiliated
and never come back and I just went back
and they didn&amp;#39;t like that and they got
have you got any mental health support
like cuz it sounds really intense what&amp;#39;s

happening it was unbelievably intense
and nobody can believe I&amp;#39;m still here
have you got to support though
nothing don&amp;#39;t be concerned look I&amp;#39;m
doing have you got

family I&amp;#39;ve got family in England yeah
are you in touch with them yeah I wasn&amp;#39;t
yeah I had been I had been no no contact
with my family till these guys at the
conservat Tre started to threaten my

life and I thought they were going to
actually murder me so I got in contact
with my family after about three years
of no contact and they knew I was no
contact as well so I&amp;#39;m in contact with

them now but I also do a really really
powerful therapy which is called um
transformational no what&amp;#39;s it
called transforming the experience-based
brain with a guy called Steven ter

in Texas who&amp;#39;s who&amp;#39;s like
a an extraordinary man okay and I&amp;#39;m
trained to do it now doing it for the
last since 2020 actually and it&amp;#39;s the
only therapy that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s got that&amp;#39;s

that&amp;#39;s been totally helpful 100% helpful
that I&amp;#39;ve ever done and so yeah in terms
of mental health support I do have some
that&amp;#39;s good yeah
good because I&amp;#39;d hate to leave you

just dealing with all that on your own
it sounds like a huge burden I think
there&amp;#39;s a lot of people in support but
it&amp;#39;s quiet because of how things are
here I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m sad that it seems to be

more important that it&amp;#39;s that nobody
knows what&amp;#39;s going on and children are
safe yeah image is more important than
child safety that really bugs me but
yeah I&amp;#39;ve been I&amp;#39;ve been a real pain in

their ass because I&amp;#39;ve everything they
wanted I haven&amp;#39;t done so I haven&amp;#39;t left
I didn&amp;#39;t leave the conservatory I went
back four bastards had to continue their
silly little game it drove them crazy so

they threatened my lie and these are
teachers and civil servants in Spain and
it was all done with the knowledge of
the school board and it&amp;#39;s highly likely
that they employed a Serial sex offender

who came in and druged me and groomed me
on Twitter
so that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s been going on here that
sounds Dreadful
yeah yeah so that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m interested

in porn really as a you know as the
essential kind of root of all the
problems
because you know I&amp;#39;m fighting
against young people being groomed into

porn and prostitution actually
and we as a party of fighting against
young people being groomed into
mutilating their bodies and and
sterilizing themselves and it&amp;#39;s all from

the same spot the same place really so
yeah that&amp;#39;s that I think that why I said
I wanted to talk about PR this yeah it&amp;#39;s
it&amp;#39;s such a big influence over Society
isn&amp;#39;t it and it&amp;#39;s causing a lot of har

yeah it is it&amp;#39;s mind poison isn&amp;#39;t it
yeah right
so on that cheery note shall bring the
bring the session to a
close yeah sorry about that thank you

for coming on to me podcast Catherine it
was really lovely talking to you thank
you
