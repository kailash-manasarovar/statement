I have no complaint, basically. So I got that, that, I got that, yeah, from the generality. Finally, I got a reply from them saying there's no that they've investigated, and there's enough I don't have anything to complain about, basically. So just a denial. And so I've been right, well, I've been terrorized by them, and there's no way I can go back. Then they've made it quite clear I'm in danger. And so I wrote to them, saying that I won't be going back because I'm actually in fear of my life, and

I published that on Twitter

today, and I got a message from my piano teacher, who also did not respond to any of my letters asking for help until today, and she says that they've been to the police this morning about matters, and she hasn't said what, why or for what reason they've been to the police, but I don't trust them, and so I think they've gone to the police probably to say that, to report me for defamation. I guess

it's criminal. It's criminal.
